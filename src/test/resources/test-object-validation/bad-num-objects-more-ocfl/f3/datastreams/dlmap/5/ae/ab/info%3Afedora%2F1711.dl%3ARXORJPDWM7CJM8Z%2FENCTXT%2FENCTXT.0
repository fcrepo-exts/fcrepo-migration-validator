How Do You KNow?

"How Do You Know?":
An Introduction to David Henige
PAUL LANDAU, DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND
n this brief introduction, I am not going to attempt to do justice to David Henige's
scholarly life. Not to his entire oeuvre, not to his extensive editorial work, nor even to
his immense contributions to the field of indexing written Afficanist knowledge over
the years. I will scarcely touch on his tremendous contribution as the person responsi-
ble for securing and cataloguing all the Africanist literature and primary sources at Memorial
Library at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In all of this and more, Henige has helped
give shape to what several generations of historians think about Africa's past. Below, in what
follows, I write only about one small dimension of David Henige's contribution: the mani-
fest disposition in his scholarly work. In my view, and at the risk of oversimplification, this
may be summed up as a question: "How do you know?"
One can observe some responses to the question after 1974 in the journal Henige
edited and called History in Africa. This volume is made up of chapters by previous con-
tributors to that forum. Here too several writers evaluate the connection between interpre-
tation and evidence. What conclusions may be drawn from written explorers' accounts (in
Angola and from East-Central Africa)? From oral traditions (Kongolese and Turkana (Jie),
Tanzania)? From court cases (Ghana), or photography (Ghana and Cameroon), or ethnog-
raphy (not just African), or missionaries' notes and letters (Madagascar)? Many of us treat
source material directly, and emphasize how evidence may serve other muses besides Clio,
as Henige repeatedly argued. All of us now seem interested in the recovery of ordinary (or
"subaltern") African experiences from existing or newly mined accounts. These two compet-
ing concerns define this book.
The open-endedness of the formulation, The Power of Doubt, is deliberate, and has al-
ways been central to David Henige's notion of practicing history. One does not know where
one is going to end up, if one is really honest in doing research. Not long ago most Africanist

historians used not to suppose that their primary concern lay in turning out a product. They
were instead desirous to uncover and demonstrate hypotheses about the past, with evidence
from the past, when and where this was possible. The separation of expert knowledge and
ecrits of quality from popular accounts of the past is central to the progressivism of academic
pioneers such as Henige; the massification of half-knowledge in popular culture (anywhere:
here or in Africa) was to be denied history's status.' It is possible to get the past right.
Henige had a precocious interest in oral traditions, thinking about them critically,
how to operate in their ambit, and soon he came to work at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison, the emergent language-tuned fieldwork-oriented center for historians of Africa.
From his desk in Memorial Library he swept his searchlight across the profession. Early
on, he turned his critical eye toward geneaologies in oral traditions collected by Westerners
in Africa, the very metier of his senior colleague, the Belgian-born historian of Africa, Jan
Vansina. Recognizing Vansina's work De la Tradition Orale (1961) as important, he did not
shy from critiquing it, seeing, for instance, elements of its interpretive apparatus as unduly
"optimistic." He insisted on something scholars should by now all recognize, that history is
not sealed and preserved in oral traditions like in a package: an assumption popular, Henige
noted acidly, in part because it is so "congenial" to fieldwork.2
Nonetheless Vansina recognized a kindred spirit in Henige. Himself uninterested in
orthodoxies, Vansina was already moving toward his own re-evaluations of De la Tradition
Orale (as well as of his Kingdoms of the Savannah), in part de-emphasizing the focus on
defensible chains of transmission, and he produced Oral Tradition as History, a substantial
revision, in 1985. Vansina's and Henige's subsequent interaction and defacto collaboration
in Wisconsin pedagogy helped produce the body of "good practice" knowledge that passed
to us in the Wisconsin African History program in the 1980s. The lessening of our expecta-
tion of historicity in oral transmissions meant, above all, that we needed to know as much as
possible about the internal dynamics of the societies that perpetuated and reproduced oral
traditions we collected or studied. Up till the moment they are written down, oral "texts"
were not the same as written texts.
The pursuit of these and other debates recurred in pioneering Africanist histories,
colloquia, and lecturers' teaching points. For instance, in his book, The Chronology of Oral
Tradition, Henige, as is well known, demonstrated how the reckoning of "average regnal
lengths" from oral traditions (in order to establish real dates) is not credible. Averaging
regnal lengths to arrive at dates for oral traditions in the past was certainly "congenial," as it
allowed firm dates to mark "oral history" accounts of the past and so to produce narratives.
But it could not reliably be done, and dates would soon be wrong by escalating percentages.
Furthermore it is often not possible to know how many generations had been forgotten or
even added, nor how long each reign had lasted, nor whether everyone recognized a "reign"~
at a given time. It was best to drop the idea of counting kings, we Wisconsin students
learned, as that kind of dating must no longer be considered historical.3

How Do You KNow?

What one could or could not claim as historical: this was his arena. One must evaluate
the credibility of evidence. The case that "[there exists] X," for instance, is badly weakened
(Henige repeatedly points out in his work) if previously the state or another hegemonic
power had a discerned reason to claim X, whether or not X. Now it has not escaped notice
that oral tradition, taken as that which is rehearsed and declaimed in public (or semi-public)
by persons known for their expertise, must ipso facto be desired by some configuration of
power touching it. According to the ordinary rules of evidence then it is precisely what oral
tradition holds to be so that must be subject to doubt; or at the very least, X being said
hardly shows that Xwas. If the historian had means to check, well and good, but sometimes
this was not possible.
Henige offered no specific methodology proper to historians to reverse the effects
of doubt. Indeed, care, cross-checking, doubting and looking for alternative explanations,
seeking out additional evidence, these techniques are only varieties of analytical thought
which you or I are freely capable of engaging in at any time. Thus, Henige has operated as
a conscience for the profession at times. He deploys careful, hypothetical thinking and open
displays of evidence, examining misprisions with interest and dry mirth. Even his handbook
on how to "do" oral tradition is a distillation of common sense logical reasoning.
The journal History in Africa under Henige's editorship (ably assisted for many years
by Jeffrey Kaufmann) became an arena for clear, evidentiary argument, openly presented;
and so, of course, it was a success. History in Africa not only featured reviews and evalua-
tions of source material for Africanists, but hosted scholarly debates at uncensored length-
some, such as Edwin Wilmsen's meticulous rejoinder to Richard Lee, reaching a hundred
pages.4 Henige only wished there had been more controversy. He recently left his editorship
after over thirty years continuous work, and his parting editorial thanked his contributors
and readers, and lauded its output over the decades, but expressed regret that provocative
points of view were not more frequently aired in the journal's pages. He had envisioned
"numerous and contentious conversations about evidence and interpretation that would in
sum advance our knowledge-or if necessary our ignorance..."
Advance our ignorance? In this Henige emphasized what his readers already enjoyed
about him. History in Africa (as a discipline as well as a journal) was a place for debates,
which are necessary and healthy, but the ideal outcome of any historical research was not
necessarily a new narrative or explanation of events. A viable outcome might be "our ig-
norance." Henige understood that historical hypotheses might break down into three cat-
egories: "X transpired"; "X did not transpire"; and "We do not know if X transpired." All
three have to be countenanced as useful in verifying (or not) a representation. In short, "not
knowing" can be a product of a rigorous analysis of "how" we can know. The research will
still have been worth doing if not being able to know is responsibly confirmed.
The critical apparatus required for this job is what he later depicted as "systematic"
skepticism. Again, in my view, "systematic" here means "thinking for an extra while about

PAUL LANDAU

verification." This creative thinking was on display in his first publications, which exhibited
"energetic and thorough" (i.e. "systematic") attempts to think about the solidity of asser-
tions about the past. All right, the early Henige would say, let us take a look at this or that
"problem": for example, that of a particular Akan stool (Abrem) in its putative existence in
the past, for which Henige scoured the available evidence searching for mention of this stool
(and therefore for a whole political history), thinking perhaps it was a recent creation. In the
event he found evidence of the stool in early dynasties, although with connections displeas-
ing to its partisans. This kind of conclusion typified Henige's modality. History is not a neat
story that satisfies one set of expectations perfectly, it is about what is real, and what is real is
imperfect.
Henige wrote further about Ghana and Africa, but would return many times to the
subject of historical memory in more far-flung venues. Thus one finds in several of his books
a world of material from all subfields of history. Beginning with The Chronology of Oral
Tradition, one finds not only Wolof and Imbangala examples, but also Polynesian, ancient
Sumerian, and Kashmiri examples, too. As in Vansina's book on oral tradition, the effect is
often dazzling. We learn, for instance, about the medieval Irish derbJhine system of political
organization and inheritance, for two pages of Chronology. The derfhine system, it turns
out, demonstrates the positive virtues of situationally forgetting one's ancestors, not remem-
bering them, throwing kinglists out the door.' Indeed there are reasons in many places in the
world that people misremember or forget.
Thirty-three years later, in an article about the veracity of places as they are located in
traditions, Henige investigated scholarly reconstructions on the whereabouts of Yamatai, a
place which features in Japanese oral tradition as a fabled capital. Again there were reasons
to forget as well as to remember. Henige hypothesizes that the "Japanese authorities have a
vested interest in locating Yamatai at a point as close as possible to the locus of the inchoate
Japanese state of Yamato, as recorded in later traditional histories, rather than in areas that
are closer to China but [and/or] more distant from the traditional Japanese heartland."6
Thereby the traditional identification of Yamatai-not a small matter in Japanese historiog-
raphy-is thrown into doubt.
Henige knew that something similar goes on in many archaeologists' attempts to use
oral traditions to understand what their digs are unable to tell them alone. Not only in Japan,
not only in Ghana, but in many venues, archaeologists have braided together genealogical
oral traditions with their stratiographic analyses, producing what they then reread as a story
confirming the solidity of both.
The pressures to attribute, assert, and produce, have deformed source criticism for
canonical, written texts, as well as for oral traditions. By no means did Henige ignore written
texts. Henige wrote a monograph about Christopher Columbus to coincide with the 500th
anniversary of 1492, and in an extended bout of detective work, he casts doubt on the mu-
tual independence of Las Casas' and Christopher Columbus' brother's canonical accounts of

the first voyage to America; as for making sense of Columbus's "numbers," discovering why
they were apparently so wrong, he simply concludes that no number-crunching algorithm
will tell us.7
There is in Henige's writing an anti-authoritarian streak. (Why couldn't those
Columbian scholars have found these suspicious concordances years ago?) But it is more
than just a discursive distrust of received wisdom. Henige understands something of the hu-
man condition. There are many times in life to remember, and many reasons to tell others,
but there are silences, too, as other critics of oral tradition's use have stressed.' Now, both
noise and silence as part of larger interactions tell us about people's circumstances when
composing their words, either aloud or on paper. Some critics deviated from Henige's focus
and pointed out how oral traditions display the mentality of people, the hidden oppositions
in their schemes of thought, the logical models they follow, their deepest understanding
of who they are (as, herein, Mirzeler). These interpretations are of great interest, too, and
Henige of course never deprecated them. He only maintained that they may be treated
alongside, or after, the value of any account's historicity is grasped.
Every year, in between writing four or five articles in respected journals, when he was
not finishing a book, Henige also wrote about a dozen scholarly reviews. Perhaps I am un-
derestimating, as in a typical year (1993) Henige published a book about the University of
Wisconsin's total Africanist holdings, six scholarly articles, and fourteen book reviews in a va-
riety of journals. His many reviews of reference volumes and bibliographies were crucial and
remain so in the midst of the deluge of exchanged information today. His reviews of works
of history most of all might be understood as an indicator of how "How do you know?" was
usually applied. If Henige was a critic, these reviews are central to his profile.
It might perhaps surprise to learn that he rather liked Stephen Greenblatt's work,
Greenblatt being the main strategist behind the English Department's turf war with the
history profession. Henige recognized Greenblatt's innovative dash and expressed interest
in the enterprise, but only wished Greenblatt were more catholic in his taste for evidence:
more like an historian, in other words. Similarly Henige liked Martin Bernal's verve in Black
Athena, too, partly (I think) because of the determination and moxie behind Bernal's ap-
plication of his own kind of "systematic doubt" to the edifice of post-war Classical Studies,
with corrosive effect. Perhaps even more compelling, Bernal had consented to debate his
critics and to meet their objections to his use of evidence, in print.
In the same vein, Henige seeks out and readily locates egregious misuses of evidence
among his peers. Some of what Henige has found must be acknowledged as intellectual
hucksterism. As a reviewer David Henige ranged daringly into foreign territory, well outside
Africa, daring to apply the best Africanist practices to weak social science. The demogra-
phy of American Indians became a focus for Henige several times in his career. The num-
bers found in the work of his demographically-inclined Americanist colleagues that offered
freshly enlarged preColumbian population estimates, were (he shows) guesses or made up.9

PAUL LANDAU

The whole demographic edifice was rotten, and the claims of historians to have proved (or
"shown") a scenario of dense conurbations throughout pre-Columbian North America,
were thrown into doubt.
Some of his targets have been easier, but all the more deserving for it. Sticking for a
moment to genealogies and oral traditions: No, the Delaware Indians did not use glyphs on
wood to record their trip over the Bering Straits made during the last ice-age. No, thousand-
year Oceanic genealogies are not "surprisingly" accurate. No, Canadian sagas cannot pos-
sibly record actual, individual people's experiences that transpired five thousand years ago.
No, Kebbi (N. Nigeria) kinglists, scores of generations long, probably do not record the
names of Assyrian and Babylonian kings because they really were common ancestors. Or at
least, there is no good evidence of such; it may still (as one interlocutor was pleased to elicit
from Henige) be "possible."'0 The sentimental legislators in Canada embody the same kind
of received-wisdom thinking when they rendered judgement on the admission of "First
People's" lore for establishing land claims. Any methodological investigation of indigenes'
oral traditions was ruled out of order.
Landing in an Americanist regional journal with big, "Wide West"-style cream-colored
pages filled with folk Appalachian coverage, Henige tells them, "An enormous amount of
human tragedy has sprung-and continues to spring-from doubtful beliefs in the biologi-
cal nature of ethnic identity." The immediate occasion was an "investigation" of a particular,
"white" Appalachian "ethnicity," producing the sort of book sometimes found for sale in
regional airports, but which had yet sold over ten thousand copies. Working from family
oral traditions the author argued that "the Merungians," with their kinky hair and darkish
complexions, were not simply descended in part from African Americans, but instead from a
long-forgotten group of Portuguese or Moorish mountain settlers. After Henige's hilarious
roasting of the argument, a childhood friend of the Merungian author with some postgradu-
ate training wrote in to accuse Henige of being a "structuralist" [sic].
He is not. Is he a Rankean then? No. "Ranke's notorious past 'as it was' was no more
than the past he regarded as important," Henige warns." Deciding what to learn about,
what to position in one's narrative, is just as important as verification. Henige would not,
however, agree with Hayden White, when White says that history is a rhetorical strategy to
represent according to an order of tropes that we already know, an order we have learned
from literature. According to White, in the end, we make sense of fictive and factual events
in the same way: we emplot them satisfyingly. For Henige, in contrast, history is "a series
of accepted judgements based on carefuly considered probabilities." These "judgements"
about the past are a serious matter, and historical work should be done "as though one's
most energetic critics (after ourselves) are watching from the wings.'2 History was not only
about, but was at least about, establishing what happened in a given place and time.-Jf not,
what is a work's claim? That it is artfully done? A good story?

Henige identifies himself as a pyrrhonist, uncapitalized. The pyrrhonist is a chronic
doubter. He or she can hardly say categorically that he has found what actually happened,
but hesitates to say "there is no possibility of recovering what actually happened," either.
Both are categorical statements, and are therefore suspect. Certainty is unwarranted, as his-
tory is an "elusive quarry." Thus with oral tradition one must (nearly) "abandon all hope"
for clarity and take solace only that in adopting such a skeptical perspective the historian
is acknowledging the truth, "recognizing that much of the past will remain dark to us."
Theory, if by that is meant the adoption of a special posture or technique-Henige was in
fact especially critical of Structuralism-hardly changes this.'3 Ultimately, "... apart from the
binding force of sources, the historian knows no authority.'14
The force of the sources is binding. Or rather, in the immediate afterthought: "Yet
this binding is more in the nature of a tethering."'" There is after all a bit of rope there. The
historian has room to stand up and decide what to say, or whether there is anything new to
say. For written history cannot be valued by whether a work is eloquent, or has moved stu-
dents to new research. "Failure to advance knowledge" is all right too, and is often wrongly
blamed on a lack of "talent and nerve rather than of evidence."'6 A dead end has to be
respected. We must esteem a conclusion that says, "I cannot know the answer, even after
looking through entire archives [etc. etc.]." It is a service to the discipline to clear away the
trash and deadwood of mistaken certitude so others can build later on solid ground. This
is his own metaphor, used severally. It implies a kind of long-term plan, not a short-term
optimism, that historians establish beachheads for future citadels.
Henige was often on the lookout for the "It's impossible to disprove" form of argu-
mentation. ("It's impossible to disprove we're not descended from rogue Europeans" is not
evidence for such descent.) Long interested in written evidence as used by historians, as I
have noted, Henige eventually came round to considering the Bible. What really was the
evidence for the existence or location of "Early Israel" and "Judah" in the Old Testament?
Not much, as he then pointed out in print. If it is so that Jesus's journey directly suggests
the fulfillment of prophecy and a recapitulation of the life of Joshua, then the status of that
part of the narrative of Jesus's life as actual history is thrown into question. It must not be
clutched more tightly (by historians) on the grounds that prophecy has been confirmed. The
Bible was a set of translations made in circumstances of great tension and pressure, doubled
and trebled upon themselves, transparently answering this or that (later-evolving) constitu-
ency's demands, fervently held to be true by partisans (believers). It was uncorroborated by
archaeology, especially before the first millennium BCE, unless a special, different technique
was mandated for interpreting near eastern ruins. In Biblical Studies one historian disagreed
with Henige in print, and argued that faith was just as important as systematic doubt in using
scripture as a historical source. The alternative was "too costly."'7 Thank you, David Henige.
Henige also wrote about the problem of "feedback," the influence (or contamina-
tion) of oral traditions by written material. This is common and has to be reckoned with,

but as a concern, it may easily be caricatured. Cannot the interviewed subject possess books
or manuscripts and live in connection with the modern world, and submit as "history"
whatever he or she feels is authentic?8 He or she might base some of his knowledge on the
Bible, for instance. But if so, it would be wise to have read the Bible when listening to him.
Henige recommended the following in his guide, Oral Historiography (1983) for what to
do if your informant suddenly pulls out a physical book ("Here is the information we rely
on for understanding our past"). Immediately, one must ". . . be willing to welcome the
chance to probe the historical consciousness of the informant and the ways in which [that
consciousness]" has been informed.'9 Written material was part of the overall equation in the
research situation. Never did Henige make the mistake of talking about tribally authentic,
versus inauthentic (in other words, colonially influenced, literate) behavior. He only tried to
distinguish history from fiction.
Finally, however, in the "shootout between elegance and evidence," evidence must
win.20 Mere plausibility is badly vulnerable to the prejudices of the writer: there is nothing
more capacious than the realm of the plausible. Historians must embrace and esteem the-
failure-to-discover-certainty, just as highly as the assertion of relative certainty.
Henige as a Voice Speaking in My Own Scholarship
The current writer can most productively represent Henige's dispositional legacy by reflect-
ing briefly on his own research. In looking at chiefly genealogies from the southern African
highveld, particularly of rural Setswana-speaking people in it, I could not help but note sev-
eral contradictions. I had not yet decided to apply any "systematic" doubt--doubt of all ad-
duced facts, doubt as to all layers in which knowledge was adduced-but I took as a clue that
people's accounts were not purely historical because, amid a great deal of consistency, some
chiefs appeared in different positions in different genealogies. More, some chiefs who were
named and positioned in written records from the nineteenth century did not appear in oral
tradition's genealogies as recollected rulers. Then, in my own field research in the Tswapong
Hills in eastern Botswana, in an area bordering Kalanga-speakers and Zimbabwe, I found
that old men contested one anothers' renditions of past chiefs' birth orders, depending on
their own position in the hierarchy of village notables. Some of them recollected grandfa-
thers and great uncles as brothers, while some others denied there was a brotherhood at all,
and confided that the fraternal linkage was invented in hindsight to accommodate a trans-
formation of the ruling alliance on the ground. This kind of situation is mirrored by several
discussed by Henige in his books on oral tradition, as I knew.
Thus I came to doubt the geneaologies in just the way Henige, I now am freshiy re-
minded, suggested they be doubted. My basic doubt was whether there was enough infor-
mation available to me (from all my various interviews with patriarchs) to construct a single,
true, ur-genealogy. That doubt then became a hypothesis. A perfect and fufll kinglist, if I had

it, would reflect no real present or past configuration of power, and so would not conform
to the way ordinary people "preserved" their history. It could not be, and could not have
been, and I was not so interested in what could not be. To be interested in what was meant
figuring out why one name was privileged above another, and what alternative histories lay
half obscured beneath concensus versions.
Furthermore, quite apart from (for instance) whether Sacopie, Thibele (cf. Tebele,
whence Matabele), or an 18th century Junior-Tebele ("Tebeyane") court gave issue to Tau,
the putative Barolong consolidator and king,21 there was another problem with the genealo-
gies. Were the recollected ancestors in the reigning chiefdoms, as they were variously record-
ed, actually all (past) chiefs? How could one be sure? Why could not some or indeed many
of them-and I swiftly came to see that I could not answer this-have been village headmen
only, or even household patriarchs, retrospectively elevated to power by their descendants?
Something like this doubt is given voice in recent research by others into South Africa's past.
In Five Hundred Years Rediscovered: Southern African Precedents and Prospects, a conference
proceedings published in 2007, "Fokeng" (or Bafokeng) is acknowledged to have been
perhaps digested at one point by another larger polity that since disappeared, hundreds of
years ago.22 Left unanswered is why we must believe Fokeng was an actual polity at all, or if
its patriarchs ruled more than a village or household for part or most of "its" history. Given
the fact that erstwhile insignificant village leaders demonstrably became powerful chiefs in
the early nineteenth century, and sought to erase their predecessors' memory on the land
(as Eldredge, herein, reminds us with regard to the Zulu); given that ancestors were all sup-
posed to be, and to have been, powerful, we might feel an extra reason to doubt the antique
greatness of Fokeng. And here one might say the same for Bakaa, Bakwena, Batlhaping,
Ba-harutse, or even Barolong, in the modern sense of these groupings.23 No doubt some
"Ba-Xs" were great, but most likely not those useful for propping up later, ongoing claims to
power. Here the argument intersects with the Nietzschean critique of the ideological utility
of "genealogies" more generally. As Foucault put it, "History is for cutting."24
Isaac Schapera collected family genealogies from households in the 1930s and 1940s
in the Bechuanaland Protectorate, asking primary-school age students to solicit "ditso" or
histories of offspring and generations (from go tswa, to come from or -of). The children's
source would be their parents or other household elders; Schapera paid a shilling per (one-
or two-page) essay. The ditso clearly indicate that obscure ancestors might become recollected
later on as chiefs, because there were later state-builders among their offspring. The result
was that their ancestors, in turn, resembled other "chiefs" of the past. The inexorable con-
clusion is that if new genealogies are ever elevated with ambitious chiefs, and they appear to
have been, then at least their past middle-range of named kings would not necessarily refer
to reigning chiefs at all.
The image of continuous tribes existing throughout long eons of history was already
scarcely convincing to thoughtful Africanist historians; it was apparent that regnant houses'

PAUL LANDAU

genealogies could not be taken as patrilineal lists of rulers of steady polities. I hasten to add
a further point first made by the other side of the Venn diagram of oral tradition studies:
the very concept of a list (either of ancestors or of tribes) is most often an alien one to the
nonliterate practitioner, a "totality in simultaneity" immediately beheld in a new way.25 In
the manner of the derbjhine recollections in Hibernia, there were reasons to forget as well
as remember. Highveld people intermittently experienced a fortuitous path of succession; if
they, judging from other places and times, subsequently regularized them in the telling, one
should not be surprised.
And so, with my kinglists, several questions which had pressed at the margin of my
thinking came rushing forward. The "full" chiefly lineages for ruling houses I take as lists of
names of direct antecedents in power, purportedly going back to early days on the highveld.
Working with the most certain names specific to the Bahurutshe-Bakwena (ba-ga-Kgabo
etc.), used only as an example, one finds Masilo, Malope, Mohurutshe, then [Mo]Kwena,
names of affiliation and legend; then Kgabo, Masilo II (a.k.a. Mosito), Mochudi (a.k.a.
Mokotedi), and Legoyane, an ongoing negotiation supervised by gerontocratic authority,
with one expects some actual biological ancestral chiefs, and then Motswaosele, Legwale,
and Motswaosele II, recalled chiefs of some degree, and then Sechele, who ruled a large state
from ca. 1830 to 1892, north the Molopo River.
By logic only gestured to here, I relinquished the idea of an actual, first Mokwena
("Crocodile Person"), with relief. Kwena (Crocodile) is an ancient and huge totemic af-
filiation intersecting with some chiefly houses on the highveld, in several divisions. There
was at one point a bypassed "super-Kwena" senior house collateral to that of even the first
Mokwena, for instance! Similarly, I demoted the historicity of Mohurutshe as an ethno-
foundational historical character, and (in other genealogies) also Motlhaping, Mokgatla,
Mofokeng, and Morolong. That is, I demur from treating them as single originators of
power or stature or place, founder-chiefs in the past with regard to Bahurutshe, Bathlaping,
Bakgatla, Bafokeng, Barolong, Bakwena, etc. Or rather: there is no solid evidence for our
locating these names as such; they are just as plausibly personifications of past political con-
ditions and affiliations, or even comparatively recently (aurally) elevated household-heads.
In fact, I now saw that whether or not the names were historical founder-chiefs, they were
comprehensible personifications of recurring and important forces in living experience, as
that is how they served historical consciousness. Armed with Henige's pyrhonnist doubt, I
returned to Hayden White's insight: the way people organize facts into sense is indeed the
same way they do so with fictions.
While it is not impossible that genealogies adumbrated historical chiefdoms of varying
duration, then, the earliest (first) period names held a different status than later ones. The
earliest names were scarcely relevant in negotiating relationships between men, and they left
no wards (neighborhoods) of descendents on the ground. The "people of Chief X" indexes
not a static body of people, but the dynamic reintegration of households in the midst of a

How Do You KNow?

history we can never fathom in its entirety. The shifting brushwork on the palimpsest of oral
tradition revised claims in households and villages, and therefore, sometimes, in chiefships.
By doubting source material, I was forced to look at my evidence more closely, and more
creatively.
The Chapters Ahead
In their contributions honoring David Henige, our authors have similarly focused on the
question, "how do we know?" as a necessary and in fact compelling part of their work. And
they have come up with different kinds of answers, complementary ones, sometimes con-
testatory ones.
Beatrix Heintze interrogates the knowledge of west-central African European "ex-
plorers," on the grounds that much of what they learned, and most of the interaction they
had with Africans, came from or through their guides and interpreters. These were "Luso-
Africans" and for a time so-called amabaquistas, daring, savvy travelers, traders, and journey-
contractors. Heintze locates several of these people by name, including Germano de Jose
Maria, pictured in her chapter. What Heintze accomplishes with her careful evaluation of
evidence is really no less than a seismic change in perspective, a rack-focus to a new level of
integration with Angola's history. Ultimately, the move is away from the gaze of the explor-
ers-already self-deceiving, and as Johannes Fabian has argued,26 bleary and addled-and
toward an overview of a much older and larger Portuguese-African trading praxis with its
own logic and coherence, engaged and rerouted by adventurous Europeans with capital and
firearms.
Richard Reid, in his chapter, holds that historians must revisit explorers' accounts of
east Africa, and look at them anew, for they have more to tell us. For Reid they tell us that a
military revolution unfolded in east Africa in the late nineteenth century. Fittingly for a vol-
ume conceived in Henige's name, Reid and Heintz may be seen, in part, as disagreeing. Reid
argues against the deprecation of written sources implicit in arguments made by Heintze
and many other scholars, and suggests that the mere readiness of these Europeans to see in-
novations and intensifications in warfare should not disqualify their observations.27 Shifts in
warfare certainly had to do with the flood of firearms and increasing internal slave-trading;
for Reid, however, there was an indigenous revolution in warfare in east Africa in the 1890s,
one we will miss if we read Europeans' accounts only as masked narratives of the European
self.
With the professionalization of observation, what then is the status of the informant
vis- a-vis the researcher? Usually, as Mamadou Diawara shows, the informant has been "the
hunted" instead of "the hunter." Reversing this conception is yet no solution, because of
course the indigenous person does not know his own history by virtue of his birth. Instead
Diawara considers the subject of "native" anthropologists researching their own people or

related people in order to challenge an analytical space, a recognized terrain: the distance
from the vernacular demanded by academic scholarship.28 Real differences between migrants
and settlers, between city-dwellers and village-dwellers, between those with cellular phones
and not, all destabilize the notion of "distance" so necessary for the Western scholar's esti-
mation of his own value. Distance is replaced by many facets of contemplation, a prolifera-
tion of "gazes."
Next, Pier Larson researches the history of literacy in early to mid-nineteenth century
Protestant Malagasy missions, part of his work on the dissemination and reconfiguration of
"letters" in the Indian Ocean. For Larson, literacy discloses and literacy conceals in equal
measure; in the making of Malagasy Christian texts, it was not always apparent who is writ-
ing up whom. Larson paints a picture of an interactive process (involving both students
and slaves), distinguishing several directions of translation and dissemination. Only on close
inspection of unpublished letters and reports does the centrality of Malagasy translators and
writers emerge from the apparent story of pioneer missionary-linguists. But we can learn
about this, in Madagascar as in the west, because the written word, even more than oral
tradition, escapes its initial intended deployment.
David Henige's journal History in Africa pioneered not only the interrogation of oral
and written source material, but also visual images. Scholarship in this area has in recent
decades gleaned much from Art History and linguistics, so that fewer and fewer historians
are satisfied with the provision of pictures as unanalyzed illustrations. Here, Paul Jenkins
carefilly examines photographs of chiefs from Ghana and Cameroon from the Basel Mission
archive in Switzerland. Paying sensitive attention to the situation of the taking of the pic-
tures, Jenkins argues for discerning a genre of portraiture, one featuring the level gaze of
the subject aimed at the camera; he finds the genre unexpectedly abundant in contrast to
missionaries' pictures of India's princes and indeed of other African leaders. This moves him
to rethink the relationship between "traditional" northern Ghanaian chiefs and Christians,
as much closer than it is usually conceived.
Kwabena Akurang-Parry assays the evidential record for understanding the appren-
ticeship system put in place in Ghana after the abolition of slavery there. Drawing on his
understanding of oral and written accounts, Akurang-Parry argues that the designation of
host-families for former slaves and pawns was for some time a haphazard and abuse-prone
system. This is surely the case, as he demonstrates; yet in reading the official record for
several "Amba"s (the name by which a great many female "apprentices" were designated),
Akurang-Parry also finds evidence of stubborn individual agency exercised even within the
most constrained circumstances: apprentices' literate protestations to British authorities; oc-
casional extensions of the notion of "family" to apprentice-master households; and flight
and escape. The positions from which subjected people act are deeply embedded in their
own history.
Blending wide exposure to oral traditions as literature with his Africanist knowledge,
Mustafa Mirzeler adopts a different approach to recorded "history." He gleans the meaning

of Jie oral traditions as they were intended to be experienced: as references to past, fixed
truths in poetic form, engaging with current circumstances or differences in or between
communities. Historicity as a concern is conceded implicitly. Drawing usefully on several
influential treatments of oral tradition as "story," Mirzeler instead argues that Jie traditions
iterated sharing and interdependence as moral features of social life (within given socialities
of different scale); Jie placed ancestral quarrels and atonements centrally in the public do-
main, creating a channel for their memory, without worrying about chains of transmission
or reading the import of each story according to hypothesized past frameworks.
The last two chapters round out the theme of interrogating the historicity of oral tradi-
tions. John Thornton reconsiders the problem of the traditions of the Kingdom of Kongo:
they differ greatly from the written record. His conclusion is that they do not indicate the
historically unified kingdom, but refer no further back than to the mid-nineteenth century
and a decentralized congeries of clans (kanda). The misleading impressions gleaned in the
twentieth century derive from a complex and overlapping set of written and oral interactions
he traces here. In spite of this radical doubt, however, Thornton cannot avoid speculating
that perhaps kernals of truth survive within the tradition nonetheless, simply because what
they refer to was so well known. Thus the prominence of Beatriz Kimpa Vita's mother may
indicate her continued promulgation of the St. Antony movement after Beatriz's death.
Elizabeth Eldredge's chapter reconstructs the probable mortality figures from the Zulu
expansion in southeast Africa, the motor of the "Mfecane." In this effort she rereads and
juxtaposes two sets of written-down oral traditions and verbal reminiscences, one by A.T.
Bryant, a heavily redacted synthesis of massive detail in the tribal-group framework proper
to the nineteenth-century, and the other by James Stuart, which resides in a multi-volume,
bilingual set, assembled from Stuart's archive by Colin Webb and John Wright. Drawing also
on many other neglected pieces of evidence, Eldredge shows that oral accounts can in fact
be used themselves to interrogate accepted conclusions. Here, the power of doubt dissolves
the oft-cited figures of a million or more casualties of Shaka Zulu's impis and suggests a far
more modest body-count, if nonetheless still a brutal one.
Following the chapters is a fifll bibliography of published sources for the chapters and
finally a complete list of David Henige's publications.

(Winter 1989), 12 (especially for Busoga), is that historical knowledge circulated and changed
through all sorts of social interdependencies and processes, and not (only) through elites' chains
of transmission. As Reid (and Cohen: "Undefining," 15) points out, East Africa was remade in the
nineteenth century such that "new syntheses" of the past emerged (Ibid.). Thus to the question,
"are there rules of transmission?" surely the answer must be, "sometimes, in some places."

News about David Henige's book The Chronology of Oral Tradition: Quest for
a Chimera ?2 and about the launch of his journal History in Africa: A Journal
of Method in 1974 spread quickly, and both became seminal to my own work.
Finally, here was a forum for methodological issues. As I was trained in source
criticism relating to ancient and more recent European history, I had always felt that too
little attention was usually paid to these issues in anthropological and historical works about
the non-European world. Soon I became a contributor to History in Africa myself, and was
able to bring up some topics that were subsequently picked up by David Henige, who fur-
ther elaborated them in his masterful way. I also felt appreciated in a very special manner by
his review of one of my books in his journal.
I was therefore quite happy about David's participation in the symposium on Sources
for Sub-Saharan Africa Before 1900: Use and Abuse, which I had the pleasure to organize
together with Adam Jones in 1986 in Bad Homburg.' Just as everyone had expected and
hoped, the first sentence of Henige's paper on principles spiritedly pointed to a basic issue
behind the topic of our own conference: "While Aficanist historians of recent vintage have
not entirely ignored written sources in their anxiety to legitimize the 'new' genre of oral
historiography, there is no denying that they have not generally devoted to such materials
the same zeal, imagination, and sense of purpose that have characterized their work with oral

sources."'4 In particular thanks to History in Africa, this situation has changed quite a bit
since then; however, due recognition has only sporadically been given to critical editions and
source criticism, as to other methodological problems related to the sources we use.' If the
journal can indeed be continued in accordance with David Henige's vision, this would be a
promising sign.

The accounts by nineteenth-century European explorers of their travels in central Africa are
today considered valuable primary sources that offer the first reports ever on the interior and
its inhabitants. In that context, the central role played by human mediators of anthropologi-
cal and historical knowledge is frequently overlooked. More than mere interpreters, they
were trans-cultural "translators," a fact that usually went unnoticed by the Europeans who
were overwhelmed by the strenuous daily routine of traveling.6
While intermediaries served all explorers in west-central Africa, they were particularly
important to German travelers whose expeditions of "discovery" to Angola were hampered
by the language problem from the very beginning: the European lingua franca in that re-
gion was Portuguese, which only very few of them had learned back home. Hermenegildo
Capello and Roberto Ivens, for example, upon meeting Alexander von Mechow, sneered at
his rudimentary Portuguese.7 Otto Schiitt only began to understand some Portuguese after
spending two weeks in Malanje;8 similarly Max Buchner began to learn the language after
embarking on his journey, when he was taught Portuguese by his cook.9 The Luso-Africans
living in the remote hinterland of Luanda, on the other hand, hired by explorers as interpret-
ers, were as a rule widely traveled and had considerable African expertise and experience.
These Amabaquistas, as they were called, acted as "masters of ceremonies"; they ad-
vised their employers, who were in no way familiar with local conditions, in matters of
protocol and gift-giving; it was they who conducted negotiations and who recommended
appropriate courses of action according to their assessment of given situations. The ethno-
graphic accounts of the German explorers owe much to them, as Max Buchner stresses:
And these wretched Ambakisten [sic] . . . play a decisive role with regard to the
successes of the travelers in Africa, which in Europe establish the latter's fame.
Whenever one found good ones, everything went well, but whenever one found
bad ones, things took a different course.... And at the same time, part of the in-
formation contained in the literature about Africa, which in a scholarly manner de-
lights the readers, comes from these Ambakisten. Almost all the names of tribes and
regions, rivers, chieftains, and customs that grace our Africa books about Portugal's
huge sphere of influence, have been handed down in Ambakist language to the
travelers who wrote these books.'0
During their journeys, travelers had very close contact with these interpreters and
other experts they had hired, and it is likely that they would sit down with them for a chat in

the evenings: all information they gathered entered their notebooks via this filter. While as a
rule the interpreters were not members of the societies on which they reported, they often
held quite concrete opinions about them. Apart from the ethnographic and historical narra-
tives given by these confidants themselves, they incorporated their own views and definitions
of the "naked savages" and the customs that they were helping to document. On top of this,
because they absorbed Europeans' conceptions and judgments about these "savages," their
"translations" were rife with those biases as well. Explorers' conversations with chiefs and
kings-which usually had to be conducted indirectly via two intermediaries, the interpreter
and the official spokesperson of the respective high-ranking African--offered further op-
portunities for such "translations." Few explorers took the trouble systematically to check
the information they received. It would thus be naive to think that interpreters' views have
not left their mark on the accounts, narratives, and "translations" that were subsequently
published by Europeans.
Without a doubt, some informants even deliberately misled inexperienced Europeans,
or exaggerated, or arrogated authority and importance they did not possess. Almost all
Africans were suspicious of the true intentions of the German explorers, and geographical
research was a particularly sensitive issue.'1 Max Bucher was aware of the problem, but was
never patient enough to resolve it:
About half of this information is based on mere inquiries that I made with the
help of my interpreter, and thus not definitely reliable because first, the two of us
were hardly able to communicate; second, he, too, never completely understood
the languages of the natives; third, he often chose to lie to me, and did so with the
consent of the natives; and fourth, even more often the natives themselves did not
know anything.12
Thanks to their accounts, adventurous Europeans were celebrated, if sometimes only
posthumously, in their home countries, as pioneers and "discoverers" of the African interior.
Their descriptions of the African peoples, languages, and life ways, their records of historical
traditions, and their maps of the regions through which they had traveled opened up a new
world to the readers back home, and provide an invaluable fund of sources for west-central
Africa. It is frequently overlooked, however, that interpreters often accompanied several
expeditions, with the result that their reportage informed more than one of them, rendering
them "silent informants.'3 Most of the explorers' original diaries were destroyed following
the publication of their books, many of their letters got lost, and their accounts were infre-
quently published, and so they have mostly evaded intertextual comparisons.'4 And popular
premises and expectations for expeditions to the "dark continent" in nineteenth-century
Europe, along with other influences, led writers to retouch their supposedly authentic travel
impressions after their return.'5 Many were eager to present the European readers with an
image of Africa as "primordial," "virgin," and affected as little as possible by European influ-
ences. Yet in fact the ethnographic reports that have come down to us have their origins in

diverse narrative threads. They must therefore be reexamined in light of information, how-
ever imperfect, about our "ethnographers"' and "historians"' most important companions.
There is always the question (with seldom a complete answer) as to how, for whom, and in
what regard, a source before us is "authentic."
III
Luso-Africans-that is, members of a mixed Portuguese and African culture-were the most
outstanding interpreters and versatile experts in these research expeditions. They usually
traced their descent to a male ancestor of European, generally Portuguese, origin. This an-
cestor, however, would sometimes have lived generations prior to the nineteenth century.
Such ancestors included chiefly conquistadors, Portuguese who held government or admin-
istrative positions, common soldiers, merchants, traders, or degredados (convicts banished
to Angola).'6 The majority of these Luso-Africans were born within the Portuguese sphere
of dominion on Angolan soil (the so-called filhos da terra), but some of them were of com-
pletely different origin.'7
For a long time, they were defined as mulattoes by their European contemporaries,
who despised and ridiculed them because of the syncretistic elements of their culture. This
applied primarily to those Luso-Africans who were not living in the urban environment of
Luanda but far away in the interior. Such deprecatory judgments were particularly common
in the nineteenth century. The German explorer Herman Soyaux, for instance, said,
I have always found the mulattoes to be a daunting breed of the human race, and af-
ter my first encounters with them I gave them a wide berth. These half-breeds, who
refer to themselves as 'branco' [white] in spite of their yellowish-brown complexion,
have as a rule only inherited bad character traits from their parents of different col-
ors: perfidiousness, deceitfulness, crafty wickedness, insincerity, cowardice. At the
same time, they have a cheeky, impudent nature. The mulatto hates his mother for
being black, and his father for having taken a black woman for his wife.'8
The term "mestizo" has therefore been preferred in more recent times. Still, like
"mulatto," "mestizo" also emphasizes biological mixing, not the historical processes that
produced Luso-Africans in Angola.'9 "Creole" is an alternative. The designation has been
propagated through works of literature (by Pepetela, Agualusa, and others20), and by schol-
arly projects, usually devised on the other side of the ocean, which focus on the entire
Atlantic region, south-to-south relations, and on the African diaspora. As a result "Creole"
has gained prominence as has "Creolization" in reference to the processes of Creoles' ap-
propriations.21
While such a convenient, comprehensive term covering all the diverse groups found
at the coasts is useful for large-scale, comparative research, "Creole"'s application in Angola
is fraught with problems. Because it has a long, multifaceted history in diverse parts of the

world, both as a noun and an adjective, even when it is redefined for a given situation, it
remains charged with misleading connotations gleaned from its other uses.22 In the Angolan
context, it suggests commonalities in terms of topics, space, and time that do not exist.
Traditionally, the term refers to a specific, stable mixture of languages that has become a
language in its own right. These are found all over the world, and incorporate as their bases
Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, and even Chinese. If these criteria are applied,
however, it cannot be said that a Creole language has developed in Angola (even though
this has been repeatedly stated without being substantiated by sources or comprehensive
linguistic evidence).21
While the cultural interpretation of "Creole" prevails in the Atlantic context, in post-
colonial Angola the term was (and is?) charged with racist meaning, being a political "fight-
ing word" used in a deprecatory manner.24 In addition, and in contrast to "Pidginization,"
"Creolization" is supposed to involve a process of ethnicization, and so it tempts scholars to
recognize some new, shared, and authentic identity, even where one does not exist. In fact
the word never became an ethnonym in Angola.21 Finally, the label "Creolization" in my
view marks Angolan Africans as passive recipients, contrary to the intentions of the scholars
who use this term. Anyway, in the future it is to be hoped that there will only be "Angolans."
Any historian who wishes to analyze processes of the past has no choice but to name
mixed and intermediary people even if there is no suitable self-designation. In my own writ-
ings that deal with the hinterland, and above all with the region cast of the Kwango River
deep in the interior of the continent, I have therefore chosen to abide by the term "Luso-
Africans," which preserves much more of the temporary, processual character of cultural ap-
propriation, productive of a "transitional stage" and not a fixed, ethnic identity.26 Thus I fol-
low Joseph Miller, who favors "Luso-Africans" and points to its "emphasis on the essential
African character of the group in political, economic, and structural terms, with a specifically
Lusophone veneer that distinguishes it from similar African groups who also adopted aspects
of European culture."27
A number of new studies on the Luso-Africans have been published. Most notable are
those resulting from research projects conducted over the course of several years.28 The in-
tensive use of the archives on the other side of the Atlantic, in particular in Brazil, has greatly
enhanced our knowledge and has brought into focus new aspects of the common history
shared between these regions and Angola. At the same time however one finds a justifiable
emphasis on the distinctiveness of Angolan culture as compared to other "Creole" cultures.29
In this process of appropriation, Brazil played a particularly important role, inasmuch as the
"European culture" brought from there to Angola had already undergone transformations
on the other side of the Atlantic.3° Yet while elements of European cultures were appropri-
ated in Angola, these were strongly remodelled over a long period by local Angolan cultures,
and there were considerable variation within Angola. Luso-Africans in Luanda differed from
those living in the hinteriand of Luanda, yet also from those of Benguela, and even more

from Luso-Africans living farther into the interior. It was the latter who became known by
the term "Amabaquistas" in the nineteenth century.3' These Amabaquistas accompanied
explorers as interpreters and travel experts. The following paragraphs offer some glimpses of
their lives and accomplishments.
IV
A new Luso-African elite emerged during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in the
hinterland of Luanda, under Portuguese influence and within the context of the all-domi-
nating Atlantic slave trade. The accumulation of wealth led to an increase in individualism
and an atomization of society, which as a result became more and more independent of
the structures of the chiefdoms.'2 The new elite was very heterogenous; it defied any clear
definition and was subject to constant change. Basically composed of black Africans, the
majority of whom were former slaves, and people of mixed descent, it also included some
whites. Their native language was usually Kimbundu,3' but they took pride in speaking
Portuguese as well, and many of them could read and write. They were all baptized, and saw
themselves as staunch Christians. As outward symbols of their high status, they wore shoes
and European clothing. They enjoyed some privileges, such as exemption from service as
porters.
In the first half of the nineteenth century they were found in small settlements scat-
tered all over the coastal hinterland, where they lived in the chiefdoms and market villages.
There was a particular concentration of them in the fertile, and thus densely populated,
Ambaka district; the most important hub for the slave caravans, Lukamba, was located there,
for which the inhabitants of the district had to provide foodstuffs. The Luso-Africans who
lived or were stationed there exerted great influence on the "traditional" African societies
both in economic and political terms. They frequently acted as secretaries, interpreters, and
advisers of chiefs, and usually also married into the chiefs' families. Many Luso-Africans were
specialized craftsmen, such as tailors, shoemakers, and carpenters. Many filled the unpaid
leadership positions in the colonial auxiliary troops. Moreover, from among their ranks came
most of the commanders of the presidios (such as Ambaka)-forts that were also sometimes
administrative centers for districts.34 Presidios provided these Luso-Africans with an effective
means of exploiting the African population of whom they were in charge, for example by
extorting tribute or by drafting porters and soldiers.35
With the steady eastward expansion of the trade networks, these Luso-Africans in-
creasingly engaged in long-distance trade with remote regions, and eventually developed
the specific identity of"Amabaquista." The term persisted for much of the nineteenth cen-
tury while losing its original geographical meaning (relating to Ambaka). It had chiefly
cultural and social connotations, and it was applied to others, rather than being used as a
self-designation.36 As early as in the mid-eighteenth century, before these people were called

Amabaquistas, they advanced to the capital (Mussumba; musumb: fortified camp) of the
mighty Lunda ruler mwant yav in central Africa.37 As they invested their profits mainly in
the purchase of women and children, they had a steadily growing entourage of relatives and
dependents, who in turn helped them to stabilize their social and economic position and
to expand their entrepreneurial activities. Like other Luso-Africans, they were "upward"-
oriented, that is, they identified with the Portuguese and saw themselves as Portuguese and
as "whites." In the south, they were called pombeiros.
Eventually the Amabaquistas acquired a special reputation for being cunning, enter-
prising traders ever ready to venture further into the African interior. This did not relate to
skin color, but rather to specific cultural traits interpreted as being Portuguese. Only very few
of them had a light complexion. One of them once characterized himself as follows: "Eu sou
preto mas com o coraqdo de branco" ("I am a black man with a white heart").38 This clas-
sification was perpetuated by those Africans who still lived in the traditional manner, firmly
integrated in lineage systems, and the Amabaquistas embraced European value judgments in
order to stand out against the "non-civilized" Africans, treating them as "savages."'39 Still the
Portuguese and other racist Europeans, in an intensifying climate of economic competition,
held them in contempt.4
Little by little, the term "Ambaquista" lost its geographic connotations and was used
to refer to cultural traits and no longer applied to any definite section of the population. We
thus need to stress again that the Amabaquistas were no ethnic group, and were extremely
heterogenous and variable in social and cultural terms.4' Those who succeeded in climbing
the social ladder and acquired standing through wealth, office, or titles-for example, as
"clerk of the court" or lieutenant-were no longer called Amabaquistas.42
It was usually the Luso-African Amabaquistas or pombeiros who first tested a new route
before their Portuguese employers, or the European explorers, followed these routes and
"officially" established them. Yet these people did not confine their endeavors in the interior
to trading trips with brief or longer temporary sojourns at their stops or destinations. Many
of them took residence in the inner African chiefdoms for years or decades, and not only
provided their African host communities with European goods, crops, and domesticated
animals, but also acquainted them with aspects of their own material culture, their craft and
language skills, and their ideological views.43 For that reason, whites who wanted to visit and
use the inner part of the continent for purposes of trade or research came to regard them as
the experts par excellence on the regions east of the Kwango River. As it was possible to con-
verse in Portuguese with the most gifted and experienced men amongst them, they were the
interpreters of choice.4 (All Amabaquistas whose services were officially engaged were men.)
In addition, they also acted as luggage managers, list keepers, cashiers, and negotiators.5 In
some cases, they knew the routes, the customs, and the currencies valid at the time; they
knew which European goods were desired and which were spurned; and they were familiar
with appropriate manners and etiquette, so important in interactions with resident rulers. All

these skills were decisive for the success of an endeavor. It thus comes as no surprise that the
European explorers of the nineteenth century were eager to employ the most experienced
Amabaquistas as their interpreters and guides.
One of these Ambaquista experts known to us by name, indispensable for explorers
journeying in central Africa, is introduced below.
V
The name Germano de Jose Maria suggests a traveler who had already accompanied German
research expeditions to the African interior. A native of Mozambique, Germano was the slave
and servant of a Portuguese marine officer before he was given his freedom in Lisbon. He
then went to Angola and integrated himself into the Luso-African traders' life. In Luanda
he encountered Joaquim Rodrigues Gra~a, who became famous for his expedition to the
mwant yav, the king of the Lunda, in 1846-1848.46 Germano probably guided a caravan
from Malanje to Quimbundo in 1863. On behalf of Portuguese trading companies he
spent four years in the territory of the Songo and three years in Cassange, the important
Luso-African market center in the vicinity of the Mbangala royal court.48 After that, he
accompanied the German big-game hunter and explorer Paul Pogge as an interpreter to
Mussumba, the Lunda capital on the Kalanyi River, in 1875-6.
Besides speaking Portuguese, Germano spoke several African languages, including
Kisongo and Kimbangala, and he could read and write.49 Germano was described as "a ne-
gro who only accepts employment on condition that he is treated as one of their kind by the
whites."50 Pogge characterized him as "highly civilized as compared to his compatriots," yet
too weak to assert himself against the porters, who according to Pogge had "absolutely no
respect for him."' Most of the information found its way into Pogge's notebook, pertaining
to history, ethnography, and geography, was filtered by Germano's translations and by the
knowledge and views he had acquired over the years.
After having returned to Malanje, Germano joined the German explorers Otto H.
Schtitt and Paul Gierow as an interpreter on their expedition to the Bena Mai living at the
upper Luachimo River (1878-89). At that time he was living southeast of Malanje where he
had "a mud hut with a garden, some sugar cane and a number of pineapple plants."'52 There
is evidence that it was generally difficult for people to get along with Schtitt, and Germano
fell out with him at the start, when he arrived at the camp two days later than had been
agreed upon, thus "proving" "that despite his polite manners he had just the same mindset
as any other porter, and that he immediately took unfair advantage of any kindness shown to
him."53 Although they learned to get along with another in the course of the journey, Schiitt

never gained complete confidence in Germano, and thought him too self-serving in their
negotiations pertaining to the expedition.
Like the white expedition leaders, Germano traveled on a riding bull, which signaled
his high status.54 This status was begrudged him by some African chiefs: at one time the
caravan passed through the village of the Kilwata-the younger "brother" of the powerful

ruler, the Mai Munene-at the Luachimo River, searching for suitable camping ground. The
villagers, who thought that the travelers just wanted to pass by instead of sojourning for a
while (which might have turned out lucrative for the villagers), pulled Germano from his
mount and mistreated him, commenting that a "negro" was not entitled to ride.55
Max Buchner would have liked to hire Germano for his Lunda expedition (1879-80),
but Germano had just returned from the interior, and did not want to embark on another
arduous and long journey ight away again.56 Paul Pogge and Hermann von Wissmann in
contrast succeeded in bringing Germano over to their research expedition to Lubuku at the
Lulua River (1881-84). Again a riding bull was purchased specifically for Germano. The car-
avan left Malanje on June 1,1881, and first followed the route to Quimbundo. From there
it moved on in a northern direction along the Chikapa River, through Chokwe territory, and

past the trade center of the Lunda chief Kafingula at the Lovua River. On 2 October, the
expedition arrived at the Kasai River.57
Commenting on Germano in the condescending manner typical for his time, Wissmann
characterized him as "always willing to be of service and quite courageous in spite of being
a negro, but unfortunately not too reliable."I' Pogge wrote, "I have some misgivings about
him, because I know from experience that he is a notorious fazenda [textiles or generally,
merchandise] thief; yet he is still one the most intelligent interpreters of the colony, and as
we already had several 'encounters' [with] each other, we will hopefully get along better this
time."'59 Later he remarked more favorably on Germano, because the latter had stayed at the
Lulua River when the two Germans went on to Nyangwe; from there, Wissmann continued
his journey to the east coast accompanied by only a handful men, while Pogge stayed be-
hind. When Pogge returned to the Lulua half a year later, in July 1882, he was "pleasantly
surprised," as Germano had cultivated rice (for the first time),60 and
the station had benefited very much from Germano's work during my absence.
A roomy house was waiting for me, solidly built on a large, well kept rectangular
square. In addition, there were nice, well-weeded paths, banana groves, herds of
goats, etc. In a word: I was welcomed by a friendly, cosy home, and I definitely
enjoyed setting foot in a comfortable and clean little house once again after a long
time.61
Pogge then sent Germano back to Malanje to get fresh supplies and to learn whether
a new research expedition was on its way from Germany to relieve him. The journey took
longer than planned. Only after a year did Germano return to the Lulua, bringing with him
new porters for Pogge, as well as some additional porters and some petty traders who had
joined him on their own account. Amongst other things, he brought "2 young cows and a
magnificent ox, and in addition 16 ordinary oxen,"62 as well as fabrics, machetes, and gun-
powder. Because Germano had not found any news from Germany in Malanje, Pogge de-
cided to return home. With Germano by his side he arrived in Malanje in February 1884.63
When Hermann von Wissmann embarked on his second journey to the Kasai in July
1884 on behalf of the Belgian king, along with six more Germans and a large caravan, he
was once again joined by Germano.6 From the Kasai he went on to the Lulua, where he
arrived in November. In mid-March of the following year one of the German participants in
the expedition, Curt von Fran ois, undertook an extended trip, accompanied by Germano
as his interpreter.65
At the Lulua River, Wissmann established the station of Luluaburg, whence he set out
for his journey downstream in May 1885, traveling all the way to Lopoldville (Kinshasa).66
Before his departure from Luluaburg, Wissmann sent Germano to Malanje to get fresh sup-
plies of goods. Yet when Wissmann returned to the Lulua in April 1886 for new projects,
Germano had yet to return from Malanje: on his way there he had lost a third of his cara-
van-thirty men--due to smallpox. After his arrival back in Malanje Germano had difficul-

ties recruiting porters for the return journey, because everyone was afraid of the epidemic
raging at the Lulua.67 While on his way, Germano met two members of the large expedition
led by the Portuguese explorer Henrique Dias de Carvalho, which at that time was still in
the Lunda region. They later told Dias de Carvalho that' Germano had been accompanied
by two hundred porters, 160 head of cattle, and two horses. They also reported that he had
chosen a new, more northerly route in order to find out whether the rubber growing in that
region promised future profit.68 Germano also brought turkeys and house cats to the Lulua,
where Wissmann wanted to introduce them.69
It seems that Germano again did not accompany Wissmann to the east coast, but
stayed in Luluaburg or with chief Mukenge, as he had already done in Pogge's time. In
mid-1888 the American missionary Summers expected him to return to Katala (Malanje
district), but he had not yet shown up. This caused some problems for Germano's porters
who were waiting for him there without sufficient provisions.7° Gemano probably settled
down permanently in Luluaburg or its vicinity, because Leo Frobenius met him living there
still in December, 1905.71
The scant information provided on this "Ambaquista" in the sources reveals little
about Germano de Jose Maria's personality. Interpreters, porters, and servants were ex-
pected to function according to European standards. Only rarely were they perceived as
individuals so important for the journeys that their contribution was recorded, except for
a few pointed aperqus, incidents, or thefts and desertions; much less was their performance
explicitly appreciated. Yet Germano's known journeys, some of which he undertook on his
own responsibility, and his establishment of Pogge's station at the Lulua, give us an idea
of his extraordinary accomplishments. With the exception of scientific explorations, he was
second to none of his famous European employers in organizing and realizing large-scale
caravan journeys.
There is only one explicit reference regarding Germano's function as an informant. Curt
von Franqois related that his history of the Mbangala was "by no means based on reports by
Portuguese settlers or on official information about the battles fought by the Portuguese,"
but was "taken from general oral traditions" communicated to him by Germano and by
the interpreter Cunha (who was married to an Mbangala woman). Even more, however, he
drew upon the accounts by Otto Schiitt, "whose interpreter during his travels in the land of
the Bangala was the same Germano who was in my service as well."72 Schutt himself however
had it that his information on the history of the Mbangala derived "from the porters as well
as from the negroes who were visiting in our camp" in the Mbangala territory.73
A comparison of the two versions, Franqois's and Schiitt's, complemented by
Wissmann's brief account,74 reveals that they are closely, but not completely, in accord with
each other. None of the writers appear to have been familiar with Antonio Rodrigues Neves'
version published in 1854. The largest part of the history of the Mbangala, which is inter-
spersed with vivid stereotypical elements, very likely originated in the vicinity of the Feira

(market center) de Cassange, where Germano had lived for two years. It was also there, in
the Ambaquista environment, that the idea emerged at some point in the first half of the
nineteenth century that the founder king of the Mbangala, Kinguri kia Mbangala, had come
to the Baixa de Cassange three hundred years before. To my knowledge, this topos in fact
goes back no earlier than Neves in the middle of the century; it is subsequently found in the
writings of Schitt, Franqois, and Wissmann.7 Information on the Lunda loosely associated
with this foundation story suggests the existence of yet another line of tradition, which be-
comes evident from the insider knowledge underlying the list of kings provided by Schiitt,
such as the remarks-which unlike Pogge's are probably correct-by Schtitt and Franqois
concerning the manner of burial of the Lunda kings.
Even though the German explorers whom Germano accompanied did not usually
disclose their sources, we must assume that much-and possibly even essential elements--of
the information they obtained about the geographical, historical, and ethnographical condi-
tions in the interior of the country was either owed to his agency or provided by him: infor-
mation, judgements, and experiences he had acquired over the course of many years, which
he now passed on in a version he himself had fashioned.
VI
Other Luso-African interpreters and informants besides Germano are mentioned in the writ-
ten records. These included members of the chiefly elites, such as Augusto Jayme, who was
the brother of chief Ambango of Malanje and accompanied Carvalho's Lunda expedition,
and Antonio, the brother of chief Angonga. They all could read and write Portuguese, were
baptized, and had adopted other traits of European culture. Antonio had traveled with
Schtitt and later, acting as the guide of the contingent of porters provided by Angonga to
Carvalho, enjoyed the latter's trust.76 Above all, however, the famous Ambaquista family
Bezerra deserves mention in this context.77 Two men, Joannes Bezerra Correia Pinto, called
Caxavala (Kashavala), and Antonio Bezerra, who affixed "de Lisboa" (from Lisbon) to his
name to allude to a Portuguese ancestor, played important roles as guides and interpreters
for German and Portuguese endeavors.
Caxavala, prior to guiding the German explorers Otto Schfitt and Paul Gierow to the
Luachimo River in 1878-79, had already accompanied various trade caravans, and he was
the first Luso-African trader to come to the Lulua River. In 1881-82 he served Pogge and
Wissmann as an interpreter during their expedition to the Lulua, and then rejoined them in
the continuation of their journey to Nyangwe at the Lualaba River. From there, Caxavala
returned to the Lulua with Pogge, and he also accompanied the latter in 1884 on his return
journey to Malanje. Moreover he had repeatedly traveled with Germano for prolonged pe-
riods. In 1884-85 he went to the Lulua with Wissmann once again, traveled from there to

the Kuba and Northern Kete with Ludwig Wolf, and subsequently accompanied Wissmann
to the vicinity of the Lomami River.
Caxavala had an extraordinary gift for languages, and seems to have been very open-
minded about historical, ethnographical, and geographical topics. He thus provided Schiitt
with, for instance, "some very interesting information about the Caxilanga of Muquengue
and the most recent institutions of the latter in his country."78 Even Pogge, who rarely ut-
tered a word of praise in regard to Africans, stated:
Wissmann and I were-and as is generally known, I still am-in the fortunate po-
sition to travel with a reliable and intelligent interpreter, the Ambakist Johannes
Bizerra Correia Pinto, who is called Kaschawalla [Caxavala] by the natives. Of all
the negroes I have come to know, he is the only one upon whom I would confer
the title of a homem honrado [gentleman]. Thanks to the reports he provides, I am
quite well informed about the local ethnohistorical conditions.79
Wissmann, too, admitted to the fact that Caxavala's role during these journeys went
far beyond that of interpreter.
My black interpreter Kaschawalla, whose memory and language skills are extraordi-
nary, serves me very well in my dealings with the natives. He is one of the most edu-
cated Ambakisten [Amabaquistas] from Angola, speaks Portuguese fluently, and
has previously accompanied Pogge and Wigmann all the way to Njangwe. Because
he had already spent two years in Lubuku prior to that time, he is very familiar
with the conditions among the Baluba, and can provide excellent, very detailed
information.80
Antonio Bezerra was an experienced traveler as well, having journeyed especially on
behalf of Portuguese merchants or their commercial settlements. Amongst other things, he
had accompanied the Bir caravan of the famous Portuguese merchant Antonio Ferreira da
Silva Porto during part of its journey until it reached the ivory market of Kabaw, which was
very important at that time, in the region inhabited by the Kete.8' He became well known
as the first interpreter of Henrique Dias de Carvalho's great Lunda expedition in 1884-88.
Because Bezerra knew the regions east of the Kwango River like hardly anyone else, he could
supply Carvalho with valuable information about the travel route, the respective inhabit-
ants, as well as the latter's history, trade relations, and customs. There is however no explicit
evidence for this in the accounts Carvalho gave of his journeys. Of all explorers, Carvalho,
wherever he happened to be, liked to take the initiative himself; he would join conversations
and engage in a direct exchange of ideas with others in order to gather and record informa-
tion about the country and its people.
Yet the importance of Luso-Africans to the explorers was not limited to their capac-
ity as expert travel companions. Some of them who had settled down in the interior of the
country achieved a special prominence in the explorers' research.82 Such describes particu-

larly to two other members of the Bezerra family, Louren~o Bezerra and his cousin Manuel
Correia da Rocha. For years, they ran a colony of settlers in the vicinity of the various Lunda
residences. Paul Pogge, Max Buchner, and Henrique Dias de Carvalho, all profited in suc-
cession from their knowledge and practical advice.
Lourenqo Bezerra-known as Lufuma-had been traveling in the Lunda region since
the 1840s, trading on behalf of a Portuguese company. In 1850, he accepted the invitation
of the then ruling Lunda king to come to his court. After the king died, Lourenqo embarked
on further journeys and eventually settled down at the court of the new mwant yav, whom
he befriended. Subsequently he was joined by other Amabaquistas, and he consolidated his
monopoly of the trade between Angola and Lunda. He introduced numerous new crops,
including tobacco and rice, and committed himself to the education of the children in his
colony and the youth at court. When the king was murdered (in 1873 or 1874) and suc-
ceeded by King Mbumb a Kat (1874-83), called Shanama, the heyday of the colony came
to an end. The new mwant yav was not well-disposed towards Louren~o, and ordered the
relocation of the colony. Lourenqo felt so distrusted that eventually he put his cousin in
charge of the colony and returned to Malanje.83
The first German who met Lourenqo Bezerra at the Kalanyi River was Paul Pogge,
and Lourenqo often visited him during Pogge's stay in Mussumba from December 1875 till
April 1876. On the occasion of these visits, Pogge always "asked for as much information as
possible on the customs and traditions of the people and the geography of the country."84
He owed his information on Lunda history, and indeed almost everything he learned about
the Lunda, to Lourenqo. Exceptionally, Pogge states this in explicit terms: "The history of
these two kingdoms [that is, Lunda and Lunda Kazembe] is borrowed from the narratives
of old man Deserra [Bezerra] in Mussumba, who claimed that the late Muata Jamwo, with
whom he had been on friendly terms, had loved to seize every opportunity to tell him about
the origins of his kingdom."85 The subsequent chapters on the "Kingdom and Court of the
Muata Jamwo" derive from data obtained by Pogge from Bezerra and from other infor-
mants, and constitute an indispensable source. Still, Pogge and his informants, who were
probably debarred by the mwantyav from conducting on-site inquiries of their own, missed
the fact that it was not the bodies of the Lunda kings that were buried in wooden urns in
the burial ground "Enzai" at the Kalanyi River,86 but only the nails, teeth, and hair of those
mwant yav who had died at home. Their bodies (with the exception of the corpse of the
dynasty's founder, Kibinda Ilunga), were committed to the Kalanyi River.87 Otto Schtitt and
Paul Gierow met Lourenqo Bezerra and Caxavala in Quimbundo, and also obtained infor-
mation on the history and political conditions of the country from them. Thus these two
Luso-Africans may well have also been the sources on the Lunda used in the account later
written by Schuitt.88

Max Buchner no longer saw Loureno Bezerra when he was staying at the Lunda
court for several months in 1880, it seems, as Bezerra felt no longer safe from the ruling
king.89 Yet Buchner repeatedly had contact with Manuel Correia da Rocha, Bezerra's suc-
cessor as the head of the colony. Even though Buchner profited from Rocha's knowledge,90
he mentions neither him nor any other settler living there, either in his various accounts on
Mussumba, or in his article about the Amabaquistas. Henrique Dias de Carvalho was very
different in that respect. When he spent several months at the Kalanyi River in 1887, and
Rocha became an important informant on the Lunda, Carvalho cited him frequently.9' The
main source for Carvalho in the colony was however Arsenio, Manuel Correia da Rocha's
son in law, who "spoke and wrote Portuguese much better than any of my interpreters; a
man who made himself indispensable to me, very useful even during my explorations in the
entire territory of the Mussumbas, giving interpretation of various dialects, handling inci-
dents owed to custom, in short: much information and useful elucidation with regard to all
the research I have presented."92
VII
In west-central Africa, Luso-Africans were of crucial importance as guides, advisors, media-
tors, interpreters, and frequently as informants for the nineteenth-century European explor-
ers. While this is documented by many references, the evidence is usually only of an indirect
or general nature.
While many sources inform us in detail about the important role played by Luso-
Africans as traders, and as cultural mediators in general, in nineteenth-century west-central
Africa, we learn almost nothing precise about the content of the respective translations and
narratives provided to their European employers. Only exceptionally do we learn, and absent
their own words, which topics they did comment on. The original diaries perhaps including
the information provided by them have usually been lost. White explorers' field notes on
history and ethnography also underwent changes as they were adapted for publication, ca-
tering to the taste of a specific readership back home. Their books were subject to "filtering"
in terms of language and style, within the strict literary and scholarly conventions of their
time. They thus became further (de)formed. Even in those cases where publications-for
example, those of Pogge and Schitt-are passed off as "original diaries," we must not let
ourselves be deceived, because these works, too, have invariably undergone editing, often
even by people other than their authors. Generalizing and abstract ethnographical accounts
increasingly won recognition towards the end of the nineteenth century.93 They were based
on the assumption that there existed an almost unchangeable, timeless, and "traditional"
culture, which is described in the "ethnographic present." In these accounts, individuals are
reduced to types, to bearers of roles and statuses within the "tribe," the basic entity and the

acting subject. Tangible reality is transformed into abstract norms. Changes resulting from
European influences were abstracted from the lived, individual realities on the ground.
We are thus almost always dealing with the results of the "filters" of the Luso-Africans,
whose contributions were incorporated into the accounts available to us today, but which
can no longer be identified as such. The same may be said for the many local African in-
formants, but our knowledge of explorers' travel routes and clues about the people with
whom they talked, permit us at least roughly to identify data they provided. Even though
we can establish very little tangible evidence of the hidden transfers of intelligence by the
Luso-Afficans, we still need to be aware of them. Europeans' accounts of the ethnographi-
cal and historical conditions in the inner parts of the continent in the nineteenth century
derived from their engagements with such indispensible men, whose roles were eclipsed in
the accounts they helped to create. The great value of these accounts too easily seduces us
into leaving their authenticity and genesis unquestioned, and overestimating their status as
first-hand, primary sources.

a "mulatto" was understood as a "mestizo of the first generation" (one black and one white parent),

usually defined as being the children of other mestizos, or of the latter with either black or white

the hypothesis that two Afro-Portuguese varieties of Portuguese emerged in Angola, "the original
Kikongo-influenced dialect of the former Portuguese Congo, and the contemporary KiMbundu
based speech of the musseques [of Luanda]", and that each was perhaps more than just a "stable
pidgin" (ibid., 16, 33, 35). With regard to the hinterland of Angola, see Beatrix Heintze, "A

26. The compound term "Afro-Portuguese" is also supportable, depending on how one emphasizes
each word, especially for the urban centers of Angola; for other regions, "Eurafricans" may be
appropriate. See, for example, Newitt, "Angola in Historical Context"; and Brooks, Euroafricans.
However, referring to the Amabaquista and other people in the interior who were historically
"mixed" in terms of culture as Luso-Africans while calling those living at the coasts Creoles,
Atlantic Creoles, Creole elite, or urban Creoles in a cross-temporal perspective, is to split up an
historically united phenomenon.

Lunda capital, documented this manner of burying the Lunda kings. Antonio Bezerra, on the
other hand, told Carvalho that their bodies were committed to the Quitu River (see Descripffio da

89. Bezerra purportedly left his colony hurriedly shortly after Pogge's departure (Carvalho, Descripfio

(ibid., Carvalho, II, 229; IV, 838), he apparently returned briefly at that time.

VIOLENCE AND ITS SOURCES

Violence and Its Sources: European
Witnesses to the Military Revolution
in Nineteenth-Century Eastern Africa
RICHARD REID, SCHOOL OF ORIENTAL AND AFRICAN STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF LONDON
Introduction: The War of Stanley's Canoe and Other Stories
I n April 1875, the explorer and journalist Henry Morton Stanley went on a military
campaign with the Ganda. His account of the experience, in the first volume of the
remarkable Through the Dark Continent,1 was one of the centrepieces of his grand nar-
rative. In summary, it described Kabaka [King] Mutesa, then apparently at the peak
of his powers, commanding a vast army-the amassed forces of the kingdom of Buganda
in conjunction with its allies and tributaries-at or near the site of present-day Jinja by the
source of the Nile. From there, the army waged a campaign, lasting some six weeks by
Stanley's account, against the island of Buvuma, whose inhabitants were accused of having
raided Buganda's shoreline and seizing a number of captives. Stanley's description was a
masterpiece, even by his own hyperbolic standards. The detail was rich, the story vivid, the
characters, including the author himself, larger than life.
There is for example the wonderfully naked savagery contained in his description of
the Ganda forces and their allies. Although clearly an admirer, if sometimes a grudging
one, of all (or most) things Kiganda, Stanley (as a Victorian, even if outside the Victorian
establishment) had still to offer his readers depictions of the barbarism which by the 1870s
they understood to define Africa's dark heart. Second, there is the peculiarly Westernized
interpretation of events, situated in a late nineteenth-century vision of war. Stanley's scenario
would have been familiar to his military-minded audience, namely a carefully regimented
campaigning war in which the army seeks a decisive, pitched battle with the enemy. Thirdly,

RICHARD REID

there is European intervention to bring about a resolution. In his depiction Stanley lends
his skills to Buganda's war effort, and introduces a startling innovation aimed at bringing it
to a successful conclusion: he supervises the building of a giant canoe, which frightens the
islanders into instant submission.
Stanley clearly deemed the Ganda worthy of his support. His military intervention was
echoed in a celebrated letter he wrote to the London Daily Telegraph calling for missionaries
to come to Buganda, where they would find a people ripe for Christian intercession.2 In the
course of the military campaign, in those quieter moments in between Ganda water-borne
assaults, Mutesa quizzed "Stamlee" about God and the Bible and the doings of white men.
Taking place on a hillside while the violence played out below the two men, these cultural
interactions prepared the way for the colonial order in Uganda a generation later. The fu-
ture had been glimpsed on that sun-kissed mount, whether or not Mutesa recognized it,
although Stanley implies that, in some way, dimly, he did.
The war and Stanley's interpretation of it are significant on a number of levels, and en-
capsulate some of the issues dealt with in this paper. Nineteenth-century European sources
pose particular challenges, given their provenance and context. It is argued here, however,
that they have become increasingly and unjustly neglected, sidelined both by postmodernist
assessments of such texts, and by the decline of interest in pre-colonial history more gener-
ally. Europeans were drawn deeply into unfolding dramas and processes of violent change
in Africa, wittingly or otherwise. Although their accounts are routinely misunderstood, they
can nonetheless provide profound insights into eastern Africa's nineteenth-century military
revolution.
We may take it for granted that Stanley exaggerated enormously: the numbers of sol-
diers and vessels involved; the array of allied "nations" and their regimentation; the level of
his own participation. Indeed, as Kiwanuka has pointed out, Ganda sources suggest that
Stanley's invention, the great canoe, was largely useless.' The story bears the hallmarks of
the nineteenth-century European eyewitness account, in which the author depicts himself
at the centre of epic and savage events, upon which he ultimately imposes himself, morally
and physically. Nevertheless, as numerous scholars have demonstrated since the 1960s, such
sources are of enormous value, especially when they are used alongside a range of other evi-
dence.4 We cast aside these nineteenth-century European sources at our professional peril.
Stanley unquestionably embroidered his portrayal of the Buganda-Buvuma war. For
all of his propensity for embellishment, however, it can be safely assumed that Stanley did
indeed witness the spectacle of the Ganda army at war, and that there are elements of verac-
ity in his detailed description of its organisation, its command structure, its weaponry. We
know from other sources that Buganda had been steadily militarising its political culture
since the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Alongside the development of long-
distance commerce, the polity refined its conduct of warfare as an extension of national
policy. Stanley's report supports the notion of a military establishment of remarkable power

VIOLENCE AND ITS SOURCES

and order. Nor did he simply invent a picturesque battle on the lake. Again, it is clear from
other source material that the Ganda had been developing a fleet of war canoes since at least
the 1840s, and that Buvuma had consistently played the role of spoiler on the northern
shore of Lake Victoria.' What Stanley was describing, then, was no mere flight of egotistical
fancy; regardless of textual overstatement, he was observing the latest attempt by the Ganda
politico-military establishment to subdue the troublesome islanders, and impose itself on
Lake Victoria. What we have in Stanley's narrative, I suggest, is a snapshot of Buganda's
nineteenth-century military revolution, albeit through a highly selective viewfinder. And
so, too, in a host of other European descriptions from the nineteenth century do we have
evidence for a revolution in military affairs across eastern and northeast Africa.
The purpose of this paper, then, is twofold, on both counts aiming ultimately to cele-
brate the contributions to eastern African history and methodology made by David Henige.
Firstly, we are concerned with the observer: I argue here that European accounts of eastern
African warfare in the nineteenth century remain rich sources, and are increasingly neglected
by historians. The problematic nature of these sources, well attested, derives in part from
the high value they placed on warfare and the knowledge of warfare. Viewed in another
light, however, their attentiveness to the subject also suggests they were capable of noticing
and registering key developments in African military affairs, even if sometimes unwittingly.
Elsewhere, I have emphasized the challenges confronting the historian in using such sources,
and there is little doubt that there are serious challenges: the racially-charged depictions and
ethnocentricity which characterized these accounts continue to exercise an undue influence
over popular (and sometimes scholarly) portrayals of African violence today.6 Here I wish
to lay stress on the opportunities these sources offer for the meaningful reconstruction of
one of the most intriguing and dynamic periods in eastern Africa's history. Secondly, we are
concerned with the observed, for I suggest here, as part of a larger attempt to conceptualize
the role of war in African history, that the eastern African region in the nineteenth century
underwent something of a "military revolution," a key component in what might be de-
scribed as a golden age of political, military and cultural creativity. In part, no doubt, these
transformations in violence were driven by the demand for slaves and facilitated by the sharp
increase in the import of firearms; but they also reflected local dynamics of state-formation
and social reformation which were several centuries in the making. The "revolution," in
other words, had both endogenous and exogenous elements.
The inspiration for the thesis comes in part from the literature on Europe's "military
revolution," still the subject of considerable debate. The first point of departure is Godfrey
Uzoigwe's paper of more than thirty years ago, one of a number of seminal pieces on warfare
by leading Africanists between the late 1960s and mid-1970s. Uzoigwe's article indicated
that something of a revolution had indeed taken place across Africa, but it went largely
unheeded and was soon forgotten as new trends swept forward.71I wish to take up his argu-
ment in the eastern African context, and in this paper I will use three main case studies, that

RICHARD REID

of Tewodros' Ethiopia, Mutesa's Buganda, and Mirambo's new state in Tanzania, to do so.
The period encompassed within the combined careers of these men-between the 1830s
and the 1880s-demonstrates the "military revolution" thesis admirably; and it is described
in vivid colours by a range of European sources which are troublesome and insightful in
equal measure.
The Case Studies
The key zones of violent change with which we are concerned are represented by three men,
each the products of their unique political and cultural environments. For half a century,
between the 1830s and the 1880s, they dominated east and northeast Africa: Tewodros, the
son of minor nobility who made the transition from frontier-zone shifta, to self-appointed
saviour of Christian civilisation in the Ethiopian Highlands, and state-builder of the most
remarkable kind; Mutesa, legatee of one of the most dynamic polities in east Africa; and
Mirambo, member of a minor chiefly lineage, who spent much of his career in pursuit of
a greatly enlarged vision, and whose challenge lay in the creation of permanent structures.
Each shepherded, in different ways and to varying degrees, a revolution in military affairs:
the utilisation of violence as an extension of "national" policy; state expansion, in part aimed
at greater economic control; new cultural and social forms created around violence. In par-
ticular, their actions contributed to a revolution in the scale and organisation of violence.
War, in the affected regions of (present-day) Ethiopia, Uganda, and Tanzania, was
highly destructive and evidentially involved a great deal of suffering, upheaval and disloca-
tion; but war was also about construction. Conflict drove creativity and innovation. For
example, much nineteenth-century war led to depopulation across the northern Ethiopian
Highlands, and in the grasslands south of Lake Victoria; but the movement of populations
also led to urbanisation and new patterns of living. New militarisms were underpinned by a
range of novel strategies, in part a response to new external environments. Political commu-
nities became markedly more ambitious, conceiving statehood in a larger way, and a greatly
enhanced military complex was a central part of the process. The new communities and
identities were underpinned by war.
In the Ethiopian region, Europeans were fascinated by the grand narrative of Tewodros'
fife, his achievements and failures. South of Lake Victoria, Mirambo's evident creativity and
dynamism attracted much reportage; north of the lake, in Buganda, Mutesa's personality
and the kingdom he represented proved irresistible to a generation of travellers and mission-
aries. But it was not simply that. Europeans were not only entranced by these personalities,
these "big men." Consciously or not, they were fascinated by the extent to which they em-
bodied larger events, processes, communities and polities. It was not merely Tewodros 'in-
cipient madness, the story of the tragic hero, that occupied the narratives told by Europeans;
it was also what he embodied in terms of the dramatic change in evidence across the region

VIOLENCE AND ITS SOURCES

in the middle decades of the nineteenth century, the manner in which he encapsulated cur-
rent phenomena, emerging issues, and indeed the deeper patterns of "Abyssinian" history.
Mutesa did not only represent the various incarnations of African manhood between the
1860s and the 1880s, from physical young bully to STD-ridden neurotic; more significant
was his standing as the manifestation of Buganda's nineteenth-century struggles and polit-
ico-military development. And Mirambo was not only the intriguingly successful bandit,
reaching out to the world and displaying flashes of military genius; he embodied the region's
violent upheaval and dramatic socio-economic change. This is what Europe beheld, and
what the sources capture. European observers represented a political and material culture
that recognized and appreciated the power of violence to achieve change; the texts they pro-
duced reflected this, if sometimes in exaggerated form. Theirs was not simply the racialized
rant-although there was plenty of that. Their accounts reflected and appreciated a period
of concentrated violent change in east and northeast Africa.
The other key aspect of this which needs to be borne in mind is the provenance of
much of the information and indeed interpretation contained within European texts. In re-
cent years the relevant historiography has given due weight to the notion of African agency
in the imperial adventures of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and in the co-
lonial system which resulted. But the same level of agency is often neglected in considering
the era of the explorer and the missionary which preceded it. Europeans relied on African
informants; beneath the European voice, there is usually another, African, voice, too easily
lost in the clamour and often mistaken for something else. At times, the African informant
is the foreground of the story; in other texts, he-the informant is always male, with only
a handful of elite women as exceptions-and is virtually invisible. But he is there, his pres-
ence felt in much of the data and interpretation that frequently posited as the author's own.
Indeed, in the very texts that are held to be the clearest expressions of European prejudice,
written by the harbingers of a new imperial order, we can also, if we listen carefully enough,
hear a multitude of African voices. Although most often in the background, a great deal of
life and movement and energy can be perceived, a textual buzz of excitement representing
the dramatic processes unfolding all around. Europeans' production of texts may be likened
to the use of tape recorders, switched on for a short time in the heat of the action, picking
up a good deal of ambiant noise around them despite the filter of their authorship. Adjust
foregrounded sound, and one discerns, crackling and often indistinct, the audible traces of
nineteenth-century African society in motion.
Naturally, we must be selective in highlighting some of the key European sources for
the ca. 1840-ca. 1880 era in eastern Africa. One reason is necessity: the vast array of avail-
able material makes it impossible to comment on more than a small portion of it. From the
1820s and 1830s onward, there is a veritable eruption of published (and of course unpub-
lished) material resulting from a multitude of expeditions and residencies, by travellers and
adventurers, scientists, government officials, and missionaries. The expansion is particularly

marked after the 1850s, when the anti-malarial properties of quinine enabled Europeans to
survive long enough to observe things and then actually write about them. But another rea-
son for our being selective is "quality control." A sizeable amount of the material that made
it into print in the course of the nineteenth century is partly or wholly useless to the histo-
rian. The literary market in Britain fed an insatiable desire for tales of ghoulish savagery and
barbaric custom in distant tropical lands, and bores and dullards also therefore published,
often with very little to say. Sometimes no amount of editorial intervention could disguise
their turgidity and fatuity.
The selection which follows suggests what might be expected from (in the author's
opinion) the highest quality of material. It should also be noted, again, that none of these
sources represents anything like a "new find" and several of them are well-worked mines,
standard sources for historians of eastern Africa in the 1960s, especially.8 While they remain
unsafe and unprofitable in some parts, with the appropriate intellectual infrastructure and
subsidy they can still prove highly productive.
Witnesses for the Revolution
The first of our three major zones, Buganda had undergone its major period of expan-
sion-both externally, in terms of territory, and internally, in terms of an ever more efficient
political and military system-in the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
By the time the first European arrived-John Hanning Speke, in 1862-the kingdom was
in the process of attempting to adapt to a rapidly shifting external environment, and was
doing so in some remarkable ways, not least in the construction of a fleet of canoes with
both military and commercial utility. Speke's account deals with his six-month sojourn in
the kingdom, during which time he dealt primarily with the rival courts of the young kabaka
Mutesa, not long acceded to the throne, and of the kabaka's mother, the Namasole.9 The
text portrays, above all, a nervous, restless state coming out several decades of growth and a
fair amount of success, and yet increasingly conscious of the limitations to its reach beyond
its own borders, and of tensions escalating at the centre. Speke's is a closely observed study
of society and economy, as well as, more predictably, of the political system, and is surely one
of the richest accounts of "daily life" in a mid-nineteenth-century African kingdom. He was
also keenly aware of the region's past and its commemoration, however controversial the
"Hamitic thesis," and how carefully stylized was his interpretation of that history. It is note-
worthy that in the text, Speke left Karagwe and commenced his final march into Buganda,
but then interrupted the narrative of his journey to present his much-discussed Chapter IX,
"History of the Wahuma." Here, he set up the historical framework within which his experi-
ences of the kingdom would be played out. David Henige has discussed the discrepancy in
the length of the kinglists which the Ganda offered respectively to Speke and then to Stanley
some years later.'0 But the central point here is this was no "history as afterthought"; rather,

VIOLENCE AND ITS SOURCES

in coming first in the story, it reflected the importance which he-and, by inference, his
own informants-placed on that remembered past as a key element in the exploration of the
kingdom itself. -
Throughout, military affairs were very much in the foreground-and indeed in much
of the background-as they were, too, in the account written by Speke's companion, James
Grant.' Soldiers came and went in Mutesa's burgeoning capital; there was much ceremony
alongside the practical matters of organising armies; Buganda's frontiers bristled with activity
both commercial and military, for the mid-nineteenth-century Ganda saw the two realms
not as distinct but as indelibly intertwined. Speke was witness to a polity on the cusp of
major change. The Buganda of his account had been a century in the making; in the 1860s,
it was confronted with changes-the advance of the Zanzibari commercial frontier, and the
attendant heightening of Lake Victoria's geopolitical importance, as well as the encroach-
ment of the Egyptian Sudan-which its political elite were now in the process of evaluating,
and seeking to control. Speke's own appearance-though it was probably not wholly unex-
pected-was only one further element in this approaching vortex. Speke, of course, brought
guns, and he made much of Mutesa's childish delight over these. But the Ganda had been
acquainted with firearms since the mid-1840s, and the undoubted excitement caused by
Speke's weapons represented part of an ongoing assessment on the part of the Ganda of this
foreign technology; it would not be long before they were adopted by the Ganda army and
integrated into Ganda military culture, and firearms-alongside super-sized canoes and the
militarisation of political appointments within the kingdom-would form part of the mili-
tary revolution that was already underway by the time Speke turned up.
The effectiveness of that revolution was becoming a little clearer by the time Stanley
arrived in 1875.12 The inimitable explorer spent a great deal of time surveying the Ganda
army and conducting research into the kingdom's violent past. He described Buganda's
military command structures and the army's organisation in minute detail, and provided
close-ups on both the army and the canoe fleet in action. Moreover, like Speke, Stanley
regarded the kingdom's history as an essential part of his exploration, and was evidently in
awe of what he uncovered. He described a parade of the great and the good, and the vari-
ously bloody, and presented a series of biographies based on information gleaned from his
Ganda guide, "Sabadu." From founding father Kintu-who was used here, as he must often
have been, to pass judgement on the current incumbent13-to an array of warrior kings and
elaborate military campaigns, Stanley portrayed a profoundly self-aware polity and one in
which wars past were being used to assess the kingdom's fortunes in these apparently more
dangerous times.
Stanley also was one of the key witnesses to the remarkable revolution further south,
across northern and central Tanzania, and indeed observed the great war of Mirambo and
the Arabs during the 1870s from both sides. First, in 1871, on his westward quest for David
Livingstone across central east Africa, he arrived at Unyanyembe to find an agitated Arab

RICHARD REID

merchant community at war with Mirambo. Exasperated at both the hold-up and at the
Arabs' apparent inability to organize themselves, and never one to shy away from a native
fight, he joined in on their side.14 A little less than five years later, Stanley was back in the
area; on his way down from Buganda en route to the eastern Congo, he finally met Mirambo
and spent a few hours with him. Stanley was mightily impressed; he became Mirambo's
blood brother and likened him to Frederick the Great.'5
Such individual accounts are enhanced and clarified when they are brought together
in a body of material. Between the mid-1850s and the mid-1880s, European travellers and
residents of various kinds were drawn along a corridor of conflict and commerce between
Bagamoyo opposite Zanzibar and Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika, and bore witness to the changes
unfolding along that critical axis. The result, by nineteenth-century eastern African stan-
dards, was a rich trove of information. From Richard Burton and Speke in the late 1850s,'6
to Speke and Grant in the early 1860s,'17 to Verney Lovatt Cameron in the early to mid-
1870s,'8 to Stanley and David Livingstone in the early 1870s and Stanley again in the middle
of the decade:'9 together, these sources describe a military revolution and its wider effects,
in often grisly detail.
This period was also described in ever richer detail by the missionaries. In the latter
half of the 1870s and early 1880s, their societies had "stations" dotted across a broad arc
from central Tanzania to southern Uganda, and so the sources for the military revolution
increased dramatically in scope. The missionaries' arrival in Buganda, for instance, from the
historian's point of view, gave rise to something of a critical mass of source material. While
Stanley admired the kingdom's organized violence, the missionaries observed the day-to-day
operations and the social impact of war, not least through their focus on the "iniquitous"
slave trade, which reached its zenith there by the end of the 1870s. Mackay's descriptions
are especially valuable, both his published account and the extensive correspondence in the
Church Missionary Society archives.20 Arguably the archives of the French White Fathers,
among them the writings of Simeon Lourdel, contain even richer evidence.2' White Fathers
ranted less about the godlessness of the Ganda than their Protestant colleagues, and engaged
in the slave trade by purchasing children (who were subsequently cared for at the mission
compound). They also observed society and economy closely, as is clear from the Rubaga
Diary, a wonderful resource; apart from the period 1882-85 for which they were evacuated,
they offered a range of close observations and detailed analyses on the relationship between
society, economy, and war. Both sets of missionaries were ultimately concerned to depict a
savage society at war with itself and its neighbours; theirs was a humanitarian endeavour,
after all, and the Anglican missionaries would become the most effective lobbyists for some
form of political takeover. But the violence they were describing, whose significance they
ultimately misunderstood, wilfually or otherwise, was nonetheless that of a military revolu-
tion in motion. Owing to the cultural framework within which they were operating, they
privileged its most repulsive aspects in their texts.

VIOLENCE AND ITS SOURCES

The main corridor of conflict from coastal Bagomoyo to Ujiji on the lake reveals the
uncertainty unleashed by the forces of commercial change-particularly between Tabora
and Ujiji-as sedentary farming communities found themselves caught up in trade, playing
host to strangers from the distant coast, and seeing their young men increasingly lured away
for long periods in search of adventure and material gain. Some would never return, and
those who did often came back as soldiers of fortune with new senses of loyalty and new as-
pirations. The sources reveal a great deal of bloody violence and as much wanton destruction
as there was evidence of political and social creativity. There were new levels of destruction
and barbarity, shocking to the Nyamwezi, who had to cope with the arrival of the Ngoni
as well as the coastmen in their heavily armed caravans. The sources also talk of depopula-
tion, describing the disappearance of villages from one expedition to the next, and the rise
of larger urban and peri-urban settlements-Tabora, Urambo, Ujiji. Alongside this were the
acts of political creativity, especially along that stretch of road to the west of Unyanyembe,
which formed the central artery of Mirambo's state. As Europeans traveled along that road
for a generation between the 1850s and the 1880s, what they described seeing constituted
eastern Africa's nineteenth-century revolution.
One of the great unpublished witnesses to these events was Ebenezer Southon, the
LMS missionary who spent three years at the heart of Mirambo's state, between 1879 and
1882.22 No European source provides more information on the Mirambo phenomenon,
but he died after a tragic accident-he was shot when his gun went off in the hands of a
servant-and he was not deemed important enough to warrant his extensive writings being
rushed into press, unlike Livingstone a decade earlier. Yet a richer source on a particular "mo-
ment" would be hard to find: Southon's often breathless descriptions reflected a dynamic,
energetic polity, at times apparently unsure of itself and yet continually engaged in creative,
if frequently violent, activity nonetheless. He described the buzzing socio-economic heart of
Urambo, where craftsmen and merchants inhabited a newly created urban space alongside
soldiers and the emissaries who came to pay homage to Mirambo. From Stanley and others,
one might conceptualize Mirambo's state as Spartan, concerned above and beyond any-
thing else with the affairs of war; from Southon's close observations, it is clear that Urambo
represented a local economic and commercial revolution, too, and that Mirambo's aims
were about production and profit in a rapidly changing environment as much as they were
about the honing of violence and the creation of an enduring politico-military complex. But
Southon also relayed much data on the latter, too, and reported Mirambo's own evidently
deeply thoughtful attempts to historicize the state in the making-to claim his violence as
restorative and as rooted in some vaguely-discerned past, where a large and happy popula-
tion is united and strong.
What is clear from Southon is that Mirambo's musings about the past reflected his
own long-term aspirations, his desired future. This was memory as manifesto, and Speke and
Stanley bore witness to much the same thing in Buganda. Mutesa's Buganda, a compara-

tively ancient kingdom and therefore imbued with self-confidence and a surer sense of its
historical trajectory, was nonetheless also experiencing a measure of self-doubt in the 1860s
and 1870s, and its political elite saw a fluid external environment which brought uncertainty
to their frontiers. The stories and biographies given to Stanley in the mid-1870s were as
much about the present and the future-Mutesa's failings, and the prospects for a great
Buganda in the future-as they were about the past. Kintu (the kingdom's founding ances-
tor) was the historical device, the political gauge, for conveying contemporary assessments.
Mirambo-similarly self-doubting, but for different reasons-likewise reached into the past;
and his Kintu was Mshimba, the last and greatest ruler of an empire which Mirambo was
now seeking to restore. These figures grew more significant in the conext of revolutions
impossible fully to control or direct, perhaps most obviously so in Mirambo's case. The his-
torical gravitas manifest in imagined founding fathers provided a useful anchor. History, in
other words, represented the attempt to place a brake on overly rapid change; it justified the
careful management of aggression and forward motion, and facilitated a continual reassess-
ment of goals.
The Ethiopian region was even better travelled by Europeans, compared to the Great
Lakes and central-east African zones further south. Following a century or so of hiatus after
the expulsion of the Jesuits by Emperor Fasilidas in the early and mid-seventeenth century,
a steadily increasing number of sources appear from the late eighteenth century onward,
beginning with the peerless (and incredulously received) James Bruce and his mammoth
work in 1790.23 Even so, it is worth noting at this juncture that the elite literacy of the
Ethiopian region vitiates, or has been seen to vitiate, the importance of European accounts.
Ethiopianist historians have focused as much on indigenous source materials-Donald
Crummey's recent work, with its extensive use of liturgical manuscripts, is a fine example-
as on foreigners' assessments.24
European sources for Ethiopia nonetheless remain a rich vein for evaluation, especially
for the nineteenth century. Such accounts increased steadily in the early decades of the cen-
tury, as the zemene mesafint, the "era of the princes," of violent centrifugal conflict between
the 1770s and the 1850s, reached its height. They map the wars of the regional potentates,
Amhara and Tigrayan largely, and the pivotal role of the "martial" Oromo; then they chart
the steady rise of Tewodros, who marched from the frontier to the very heart of the old
Solomonic imperium, which he then proceeded to reinvent. For Ethiopia, compared to our
regions further south, there was a much deeper well of foreign information, dating to the
Portuguese expeditions of the early sixteenth century. Europeans in the nineteenth century
had perhaps only recently have returned to northeast Africa, but they were able to draw on
a body of literature stretching back over three centuries, not to mention fevered imaginings
stretching back a couple of centuries before that. Thus Ethiopia is especially well served,
by eastern African standards, and European authors referenced one another from the late
eighteenth century onward, sometimes to challenge predecessors' findings, but certainly

VIOLENCE AND ITS SOURCES

to evaluate the level of "knowledge" developed. Arguably were better placed than in most
other parts of Africa to judge the scale of change unfolding before them.
Of course, Ethiopians were long regarded as different from-that is to say, superior
to-their cousins elsewhere across the supposedly benighted continent, and the tone ad-
opted frequently reflects this. European travelogues routinely contained lengthy historical
overviews, and it was this appreciation of the antiquity of Ethiopian civilisation which justi-
fied somewhat more reverential tones-however far contemporary Ethiopians had appar-
ently fallen from former glories. These journeys into the past usually had as one of their
centrepieces the events of the 1530s and 1540s, when a jihad led by Ahmed ibn Ibrahim had
swept from the Somali plains to the southeast up into the very heart of the Solomonic state,
bringing it to its knees before a Portuguese expedition had assisted in achieving a last-minute
reversal of fortune; even Edward Gibbon referenced it.25 It was a deadly struggle for survival
that was regularly recalled by Ethiopian leaders in the nineteenth century.
Few Europeans in the nineteenth century doubted the fundamental role of warfare
in Ethiopian history, and the degree to which violent militarism underpinned political au-
thority. This is evident in the accounts of those who journeyed across the region between
the turbulent 1810s and 1840s, for example Henry Salt, Samuel Gobat, Nathaniel Pearce
and Mansfield Parkyns.6 But it was Walter Plowden who provided one of the best accounts
of the nature and meaning of Ethiopian warfare of the period.27 Resident in the region in
the mid-1840s, and for much of the 1850s, as well as being an Amharic speaker, Plowden
dedicated two substantial chapters of an extraordinarily detailed description of mid-century
state and society to the army and military culture. The "military class" he examined was a
topic about which he was deeply knowledgeable, given his personal experience on campaign;
it had been a long time in the making, but the military culture he described in the middle
decades of the nineteenth century was now clearly driving rapid political change. This was
the beginning of a period in which the restless militarism which underlay highland political
culture, and which had become ever more significant since the late eighteenth century, was
crystallizing into something rather more professional and altogether more effective, under
the direction of a handful of talented leaders-Tewodros among them. It would be used,
ultimately, to build the modern empire-state of Ethiopia.
Walter Plowden was killed on his way homeward in 1860; it was left to his brother
to compile and edit the remaining sections of his notes and correspondences into a work-
able manuscript. Toward the end of that manuscript, Plowden assessed the rise of a young
borderland chief named Kassa-later crowned as Tewodros-commencing the European
fascination (in print as well as policy) over the next twenty years with this extraordinary
individual and what he represented. While it was expedient to position the narrative around
Tewodros, in fact the chief was the product of the emergent military culture that earlier
writers had described, and the clearest manifestation of the unfolding revolution in military
affairs. There was a clear shift in attitude from the mid- and late 1850s to the period from the

RICHARD REID

early 1860s onward. The depiction of Tewodros changed from energetic and clearly superior
state-builder and warrior, to mad, sad African potentate, raging against a world he scarcely
understood from his rocky and isolated citadel. His violence, once righteous and even nec-
essary to bring order to a wild and unsettled region, came in the 1860s to be characterized
as barbarous and unstable. His madness was dangerous, which was clearly revealed once
Tewodros clapped the European community in irons, in retaliation against a perceived slight
on the part of the British Government. It consumed him, and once his earlier achievements
faded, only the insanity remained.
In addition to the accounts of the earlier 1860s-those of Dufton and Stern, for ex-
ample28-there was then naturally a flurry of publications around the subsequent British
campaign against Tewodros and the drama at Magdala. Captives, liberators and "embed-
ded" journalists all produced accounts-from the captives Blanc and Rassam, to Hozier and
Markham, members of the British expedition, to a young and very green Henry Morton
Stanley, covering the story for the New York Herald.29The standard narration of these events
spoke to a strong British sense of self in the last third of the nineteenth century, and the
era's language and tone, as every student of history knows, must be understood in that con-
text. Britain was able to mount a logistically challenging military campaign and was willing
to act to free hostages, including non-British nationals. Importantly, too, the British force
would not remain in occupation, but withdraw triumphantly, having liberated a people from
tyranny. But it needs to be emphasized that the British had been drawn into an unfold-
ing Ethiopian revolution; Europeans were awarded a bit-part in this great drama, and the
sources reflect this.
As there was Plowden in the 1850s, half a century later in the 1890s there was
Alexander Bulatovich.0 A Russian cavalryman, and an expert witness on military affairs,
Bulatovich produced a reflective and thoughtful account-though with its fair share of der-
ring-do--of the "state of Ethiopia" at the century's close. As he travelled with Menelik's
triumphant armies across the south and west of the expanding Amhara empire in the wake
of the battle of Adwa, he was in no doubt about the role of militarism in this "new" political
system, nor that something of an upheaval in military affairs had taken place in the course
of the nineteenth century. His prognosis was grim-Ethiopian militarism was essentially
unsustainable, in economic terms-but he clearly deeply admired the political-military com-
plex which Menelik had harnessed with some considerable skill. Others, too, marvelled-
tacitly or otherwise-at this potent polity and its appreciation of the transformative power
of violence. Even before Adwa, British diplomat Gerald Portal, in the late 1880s, had de-
scribed a forceful militarism in the making;3' but after Adwa, especially, Europeans clustered
around to survey this curious creation in northeast Africa which had not only survived the
"scramble" but participated in it: Berkeley, Rey, Wylde, to name but a handful.32 How long
Ethiopia would last, no-one knew. But they recognized what had happened, at least up to
now: Ethiopia was built on war, and in the second half of the nineteenth century its leaders

VIOLENCE AND ITS SOURCES

had learnt how to channel that violent militarism into something ruthlessly coercive, and
politically creative, across an enlarged theatre of operations. It was a process which European
onlookers well understood.
Sources and Opportunities: Imaginings and Realities
There is little question that these same sources pose significant challenges for the historian.
The late Victorian view of African violence in fact has its roots in the era of the Atlantic slave
trade, and more specifically in the pro- and anti-abolitionist debate which raged in the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. For defenders of the slave trade, the commerce
in human beings had not produced any increase in the levels of violence within Africa;
African societies were already intrinsically bloody, and indeed the slave trade was something
of a blessed release from a conflict-ridden land. Abolitionists argued that the commerce
had fuelled relentless violence within the continent, and had reinforced the savage element
present within African culture; Europe's "civilising mission" should now be to save Africans
from themselves, by facilitating pacific activities and, where necessary, intervening directly
to bring this about. Both camps perceived rampant savagery in the violence; the difference,
reflected in broader debates about race in the early nineteenth century, lay in whether that
savagery was believed to be inherent or whether it was seen as fostered by sinister external
pressures. Thus were the terms of the modern debate set, the parameters fixed within which
both policy and perception would operate. It led to the creation of a moral and intellectual
framework within which the "scramble" for Africa was not only possible but imperative.
In sum, Africa was indeed a savage and violent place; the salvation of the African (as the
abolitionists had believed) was certainly possible, but it was now clear, in the mid- to late
nineteenth century, that only the most forceful intervention on the part of Europe would
bring this about. Africans lacked the mental and cultural equipment necessary to do this for
themselves. It was abolitionist humanitarianism with a hardened racial edge.
Thus contemporary European sources are replete with references to the savagery of in-
terminable African warfare, and continually make more or less explicit connections between
race and violence.33 Europeans were able to make essential judgements about each com-
munity they encountered: one was "warlike," another "peace-loving." Across our region,
northerly, "lighter" skinned, pastoral peoples were depicted as more "warlike"-and, in vari-
ous ways according to the author, discernibly more civilized, or at least more admirable-
than their squatter, darker, agricultural neighbours. Thus were the Oromo, the Maasai, the
Tutsi, frequently held up as fine representations of warlike manliness, which in turn meant
racial superiority34 This often flew in the face of the evidence, namely that the primarily ag-
ricultural states north of Lake Victoria and in the Ethiopian Highlands were the dominant
military powers in their respective regions, but no matter: the image of the individualistic,
courageous and dignified pastoralist crystallized, and indeed has endured. Nor was European

RICHARD REID

testimony always consistent when it came to discussions of what actually constituted "proper
war." While some depicted terrible and dramatic savagery, others sneered that these "wars"
were in fact quite pathetic and hardly amounted to anything worth recording (although they
all went on to record it). Markham wrote dismissively of the "interminable ... skirmishes"
of the Abyssinians; Stanley declared that the physical constitution of the African was not
conducive to "energetic warfare."3 Burton's east African is alternately a lazy drunk, or an
inveterate cattle-rustler and kidnapper, these activities constituting "war" in the region.36
The missionary Alexander Mackay managed to hit two targets at once when he declared that
although these "little wars" were "of no account in Europe," they were nonetheless pretty
nasty and involved large scale killing and destruction.7
By the same token, late Victorians clearly admired bloody savage power, and could
scarcely contain their glee when they believed they had found it. Semi-civilized potentates
were depicted as surrounded by savage hordes, which pressed in on their ravaged and wild
frontiers and yet were somehow held at bay.38 Powerful and articulate elites were racially
enhanced by excited Europeans and portrayed as possessing the capacity to act as vehicles
in the civilisation of the region. Even a man of God, such as Mackay, quietly admired the
Ganda and foresaw that their military prowess and expansionist proclivities-so awful when
beheld in a pre-European setting--could be harnessed for the good of the wider region.
Buganda, in sum, had civilizing potential.39
Critical assessments of these kinds of texts draw inspiration from the work of Edward
Said,40 among others, whose argument regarding Western representations of the "Oriental"
(or African) Other is much celebrated, though also critiqued.41 A rampant Eurocentrism,
in sum, was the chief characteristic of the Western imperial project through the nineteenth
century and into the first half of the twentieth, which distorted the image of the world
beyond in order to position European modernity at the core of global time and space.42 At
its extreme, postcolonial, Said-influenced scholarship has argued in recent years that we can
take nothing from these sources except what they tell us about the author and his culture.
It is clear enough that Victorian imagery has proved resilient, and that misinterpreta-
tions in the nineteenth century echo down to the present day. However, such misinterpre-
tation notwithstanding, there is still plenty to use in those same sources, for the diligent
scholar.43 In large part, this is because Europeans frequently, even if unwittingly, recognized
the significance of the events and processes and leaders they were observing and reporting
upon. In many ways they were indeed informed by their own cultural and historical experi-
ences and reference points. Travelling Europeans were inevitably drawn to the military af-
fairs of the societies through which they passed, and characteristically they used events and
personalities in Europe's own military past as the cardinal points on their historical compass.
This presents problems for the researcher, naturally; but the obverse point--one which is
often neglected-is that because nineteenth-century Europeans were often drawing on their
own recent past (i.e., Europe's history since the sixteenth century), they were well equipped

VIOLENCE AND ITS SOURCES

to notice dramatic change in military organisation. If there was one area in which Europeans
were expert, it was the business of war, even if they misapprehended the cultural and socio-
economic contexts within which that business was conducted.
Especially in the Ethiopian region, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europeans
thus credited habesha warfare with characteristics of their own past, including ideas about
honour, chivalry and bravery, as well as tactical and strategic proficiency: "Abyssinia" re-
minded them of bygone feudal Europe. "The present state of Abyssinia," wrote Henry Salt
in 1814, "may with justice be compared to that of England previously to the time of Alfred;
the government of the country being formed on the model of a complete feudal system."44
If the Anglocentric reference points are unhelpful in themselves, Salt's snapshot of the tense
balance of power early in the century is especially useful when placed alongside later descrip-
tions of the organized violence that culminated in the accession of Kassa Haylu as Emperor
Tewodros. In other words, Europeans' "bias," the range of reference points available to
them, were not always or necessarily "irrelevant" or "misleading," and the reverse was in
fact frequently true. By the same token, European views ofAfrican warfare in many respects
reflect meaningfifly on their views and experiences of "Western war," and careful reading
of these accounts may well also reward the scholar of European military history. Ultimately,
one returns to one of the necessities of the historian's practice: to manage unruly sources,
and to harness their energy to power the reconstruction of the past.
The importance of European sources is hardly in doubt to the vast majority of profes-
sional practitioners no matter how problematic their usage in African history has been.41
Recently some historians have again argued for the enormous value in rereading supposedly
hopelessly compromised texts. Meredith McKittrick's assessment of missionary records for
pre-colonial northern Namibia is a fine case in point; Robin Law's work on the West African
coast during the slave trade is another indication of the critical importance of European
sources.46 The utility of these sources certainly increases with their quantity; Yoruba country
in the course of the nineteenth century, for example, became a major zone of operations for
a host of missionary organisations and hence textual evidence.47 I would argue that the same
is true of the zones discussed in this paper, on the east and northeast sides of the continent.
Another argument against the use of such sources is that they are highly selective,
choosing to highlight those elements of the overall "African experience" which show the au-
thors in a positive light or are simply of interest to readers. It is however quite misleading to
see European travellers-the supposed outriders of so many approaching imperialisms-as
imposing themselves on these places and processes. Europeans did not simply "pick" locales
and write about them. Rather, the places chose Europeans, as it were: European sources, like
many of the agencies of imperialism which came later, were co-opted into African worlds.
Europeans followed well-trodden or emerging highways into the "interior," and approached
the people and places described in their accounts because they were important, and because
they were ultimately unavoidable. The notion that Europeans could be "selective" about

RICHARD REID

what they described-beyond the most basic process of selection involving in recalling a
particular experience, maintaining a journal, writing it up for publication later-is to ascribe
to these travellers an extraordinary power over their own experiences and a remarkable abil-
ity to manipulate those with some larger end in view.
In other words, it is undeniable that there is selection in some of the essential detail,
notably in terms of racial reference, and in accounts of brutality and horror; there are ele-
ments in the interpretation which have been emphasized over others.48 But the stories which
Europeans told were part of a meta-narrative which was African, not European; in terms of
our region, Mutesa, Mirambo, and Tewodros were individuals and representatives of states
and processes that attracted attention for a variety of compelling reasons, and which left pro-
found impressions on those who visited them. In this way they imposed themselves on the
stories later told with such bravado in the clubs and learned societies in London and Paris by
returning muzungu and ferenji "heroes."
Rehabilitating Violence and Its Sources:
The Nineteenth Century in Perspective
This paper has made two main arguments. The first is that a careful, integrated and holistic
reading of the European sources from the era is extremely rewarding, and sheds a great deal
of light on the processes under examination; and just as the European texts are themselves
full of misapprehensions and distortions, they themselves have been routinely misunder-
stood by scholars immersed in postmodernist and indeed presentist agendas. In fact, such
sources reveal a huge amount about the revolutionary nature of African warfare. They often
reached the wrong overall conclusions (e.g. the essential primitiveness and cultural savagery
of African violence) owing to the frameworks in which they were doing the business of ob-
serving and then writing; and those conclusions have proved remarkably resilient, muddying
the waters of comprehension ever since, through Africa's violent twentieth century, an era
when comprehension was never more important. But they absorbed an enormous amount
of what was going on around them, and understood a great deal more than they have fre-
quently been given credit for. Moreover, this exercise is also concerned with serving the
needs of a global history. This is not simply a standoff between observer and observed, each
habitually misunderstanding and confusing the other; rather, we are seeking some level of
integration, a degree of fusion, of European and African experiences. The evidence for that
fusion-the recognition, whether implicit or otherwise, of shared experience-is contained
in the pages of the texts under discussion here. Again, if there was one thing nineteenth-
century Europeans grasped, it was war and the utility and significance of violence, even if
they routinely misapprehended what much of it meant. They racialized it, and saw a violent
continent in need of outside assistance. They were right, in many respects, to espy a violent

VIOLENCE AND ITS SOURCES

continent; but they misread the meaning of this violence, wilfully or otherwise, and were of
course wrong about both the racial aspects and the need for external intervention.
The second argument made here is that the nineteenth century witnessed something
of a military revolution in eastern Africa; indeed, I would suggest that the central thesis
holds true of much of the continent during this period. We need to look more closely at the
nineteenth-century roots of Africa's violent modernity; Africa in the late twentieth and early
twenty-first centuries can be fully understood only by examining that violent and vibrant era.
The brief colonial interlude served to distort key processes of political creativity which had
built into something of a "golden age."
The violence reported by Europeans accelerated the "scramble" for Africa. The
European invasions from the 1870s until the 1920s were made possible, firstly, by the high
level inter-state and inter-communal conffict across the continent in the second half of the
nineteenth century, providing relatively small and even innocuous European forces with
leverage and opportunities for success. Secondly, in terms of manpower, several decades of
violence had produced large numbers of the rootless and the displaced, a swelling popula-
tion of the willing and able, which could be recruited into armies willing to provide some
basic sustenance via adventures which also brought certain perks. Without this, Europe's
partition would have been unthinkable; African manpower, set loose by the prolonged mili-
tary revolution, made the European "scramble" possible.
We do not have to agree with contemporary Europeans' conclusions about what all
this violence meant to recognize that they were describing a remarkable sequence of events
and processes through which much of Africa was transforming itself. So this is a matter of
managing Victorian imagery: there is enough data behind it to facilitate a useable history of
African violence. It is therefore imperative that we embark on a more nuanced understand-
ing of Africa's nineteenth-century military revolution, and eastern Africa offers an excellent
case study for the purpose. The violent past needs to be rehabilitated, and the nineteenth
century seems a good place to start.

"The natives' ipsissima verba represent an ultimate datum of reality without the
blurring screen of a free translation, which should be used only as a supplement
to the interlinear rendering. Of course, an intelligent non-professional observer
familiar with the language and collaborating by correspondence with an ethnologist
may learn to interpret native life "from within" while simultaneously answering the
specialist's queries. Boas early recognized this possibility, and his encouragement
of James Teit, a squaw man settled in British Columbia, led to a series of splendid

ike any doctoral candidate doing research on oral traditions, I had to collect a
large body of data. Just as it is today, the rules of the discipline back then required
methodological reflection on the entire body of information gathered. At the
time, I had chosen to analyze the relationship between the Soninke researcher that
I identify myself to be, and the topic of my research in Soninke country, the traditionalists.
It was as if I were observing my own working conditions from a critical distance. Once I
had defended my thesis, Emmanuel Terray strongly encouraged me to rework my text into
an article. This was published by Cahies d'Fttudes africaines in 1985 and bore the title "Les

MAMADOU DIAWARA

While carrying out research in Kingi, my land of origin, in the Nioro District of the
Sahel in Mali, I described my experience in the following way, though here I am also adding
a few similar observations made by researchers such as Dida Badi and Fatoumata Ouattara.3
Presumably I was benefitting from "the advantage of being on my own turf." However,
this benefit came at a high cost when it came time for me to make some "required choices." I
was automatically adopted by my family of origin, that is, my father's family. However, they
naturally had expectations of me that lined up with those of the larger community. These
"cultural expectations" of the informants place constant pressure on the researcher that ulti-
mately requires him to make a difficult decision. Since the success of my research trip and my
reimmersion in my own society depended on the satisfaction of these expectations, the dif-
ficult daily test for me was to carry out my research according to scientific standards, which
were different from the local way of doing things.4Ouattara's remarks coincide perfectly
with my own sense of the confused blending of genres to which our hosts constantly beckon
us.' Specifically, if you are either the classificatory or real daughter or son of your interlocu-
tor, then you have already partially distorted the terms of the exchange that the researcher
seeks to establish, those according to his own standards. This is what required Ouattara,
for example, to choose a different residence from the one automatically made available to
her by the host community.6 D. Badi calls this tendency on the part of our hosts to impose
their way of doing things "harnessing" ("la captation"). It is our responsibility to carry out
a procedure that consists of disassociating oneself on a daily basis.7
The difficulty of learning in the field worsens when faced, as I was, with a normative
order of acquisition of knowledge that generates its own system of oral tradition schools
and where the foundations of knowledge happen to be hierarchical and carefully controlled.
How then was I to reconcile my university training-which by the way also contains its own
internal hierarchy-with that of the traditionalists, in a context of project deadlines in which
every month, even every single day, counts?8 In my case I was working hard to collect data
on all kinds of oral traditions, which was unlikely to please my local mentors, as who ever
heard of studying oral traditions of subordinate groups and aristocratic traditions at the
same time-and both men's and women's texts? These intrusions into areas at all levels of
the social scale were sure to arouse suspicion, as traditions-especially the codified ones-are
reserved for specific groups. The researcher, therefore, must be somewhat of a chameleon,
whether he is aware of it or not, and take on (or at least pretend to take on) all of these dif-
ferent identities.9 In Ouattara's case, she had to frequent places reserved only for men. She
had to cross, and not without disapproval, the "boundaries of gender" and frequent social
spaces to which she was not supposed to belong.'0 These deviances are all the more difficult
to negotiate because the native researcher, more than anyone else, is carefully identified as
such upon his arrival by his future interlocutors. Depending on their information, they may
or may not talk to him or her. Badi's Tuareg interlocutors from l'Adagh des Ifughas, a coun-
try nestled between Mali, Algeria and Libya, were constantly subjecting him to the following

preliminary questions: Who are you? What are you doing? What did they tell you about X?
What do you think of it?
More than ever it is important here to be modest enough to recognize one's own
limits in the area of languages. Is it so shameful for an average German not to understand
the poetry of Goethe? Why should I be embarrassed when I, a Soninke, do not always
understand the texts of the Geseru?" You only realize this once you learn to distinguish
between the categories of high culture and popular culture.12 The language of high culture,
Xaran Xanne, and the language of everyday life, Xanne, come from two distinct spheres.
Obviously the languages are not isolated from each other, but the researcher needs time to
learn to move from Xanne to Xaran Xanne. Ouattara attributed this problem to linguistic
incompetence, but the process of knowledge acquisition is by its very nature slow and com-
plex.'3
I had carried out similar research in other countries before, and many colleagues and
students have responded to my work. This produced another factor in the making of criti-
cal distance emerged during my home research. When I was conducting interviews on less
sensitive topics not directly linked to sources of power, I had time to sift through and analyze
the reflections I had formulated about my own practice. I wanted to re-examine my own
work critically, in the light of the new ground that had been covered by the profession and
the new methodologies that had become current.
In fact, as it has been shrewdly pointed out by David Henige, "In the ebb and flow of
the past forty years, various sources and various approaches have come and, in some cases, gone
as well."14 Scientific discourse is affected by the latest fads, schools of thought, and intellec-
tual currents. The article in question was produced by me in an intellectual space somewhere
between France and Mali, and steeped in the ambiance of the decline of Marxism. With the
criticism of the colonial situation in the 1950s by Michel Leiris and Georges Balandier, his-
tory had found its way into ethnological objects.'5 The Annales school had gained control of
historians as well as anthropologists, especially since the latter were moving toward the study
of history. The result was high-quality work in African studies.16
During the two years that followed the publication of my article, I lived in Mali in
French-speaking circles, which determined howI was influenced by specific academic trends.
Postcolonial studies developed in importance in Great Britain and in the United States, but
hardly took off at all in French academic circles.17A stormy debate on ethnicity was launched
by the publication of J.-L. Amselle's and M'Bokolo's jointly-edited book in 1985. In France,
the debate was pursued by Jean-Pierre Chrtien and Gerard Prunier, among others. And so
the concept of ethnicity as applied to Africa began to be re-examined in depth.'8
Post-structuralism arrived late in French-speaking African countries, and indirectly,
through North American and British literature. The trend towards "Subaltern Studies,"
although not very influential in France or francophone Africa, also had some impact.'9 Jean-
Loup Amselle in a stinging attack accused certain French intelligentsia of enjoying an en-

gagement with an originally French school of thought only after it was frted in the United
States in the 1980s and 1990s.20 Criticism of colonial literature, of the history texts pro-
duced and narrated by the colonizers, continues to rage in France.2' At first the issue of the
working conditions of native researchers belonging to a specific ethnic group was not dis-
cussed in these contexts; nor was this done in the best work of English-language authors.22
Sophie Dulucq and Colette Zytnicki's articles have analyzed the contributions of Africans
working as staff members for colonial administration, commencing a debate that has already
been underway in India for several decades.23 Finally Jean Copans meanwhile has crafted an
uncompromising analysis of the field of anthropology in France and elsewhere.24
A more active involvement of researchers from the former colonies in a field that was
once reserved for the specialists from the Western powers started to gain ground in the
1980s. At this time, intellectuals from Southeast Asia were infiltrating the fields of humani-
ties and social sciences in North American and in British universities.25 They explored the
question of whether it was an advantage or a disadvantage to carry out research on one's
own society. Their analysis of the situation was all the more welcome since the problem had
never been properly raised by their academic mentors, the Western ethnologists.26
How might I approach an article written twenty-five years ago, the writing, initial
reception, and present re-reading, which correspond to different stages in the succession of
multiple intellectual currents? Can a parallel be drawn between such a discussion focused on
Africa and debates in Southeast Asia and America? The Greek polis applied the term ethn? to
those who were foreign to them, and our discipline is founded on this opposition and essen-
tialism.27 Ethnological discourse is the discourse of the urban elites, of the West describing
the Other, of the universal subject describing the essence of the object. Is it then possible for
a discipline founded on this paradigm to be transformed once the ethn pitches his and her
tent in the land of the subject?28 What happens when the comfortable dichotomy fades away?
Today's Debates
In what follows, I will juxtapose the clear-cut theses of earlier ethnologists (such as Lowie)
who subscribed to the dogmas of distance and exoticism, with those of some of our con-
temporary colleagues in anthropology and history, for whom otherness remains firmly en-
trenched even as the prestige of exoticism fades away.29 We will take a look at the stances
taken by unashamed colonial administrators (see the Revue de l'Histoire de Colonies fran-
raises), and see the contrast between them and the embarrassed silence kept by most of us,
the local researchers.30 Our Western colleagues when they work in Western fields of study
have only begun to question their methods.31 To be sure there are observations on the topic
scattered through Ph.Ds and unpublished manuscripts; as Jeanne Favret-Saada has pointed
out, most accounts of field experience are relegated to places "Outside the [main] text" such
as the foreword, the introduction, the appendix, or to autobiographical novels.32 Even fewer

THE OSMOSIS OF THE GAZES

of us non-Westerners reflect on our own positions, researchers working on their native turfs
while adhering to methods borrowed from a science developed in the West.33
At least for my generation, who started school after many states achieved national in-
dependence in the 1960s, to acknowledge this problem was to admit to being powerless to
fulfill one's duty: to write one's own history and challenge the history written by the colo-
nizers. Back in 1985 1 referenced one particularly bold remark that "the observers within the
social sciences must come from those societies they observe. They are in a better position to
detect these societies' subtlest aspects."34 This point of view, an Algerian one, grew out of
and against the supremacy of French researchers working in francophone Africa. And if few
people express such a sentiment publicly, there are many who share it.35 Achille Mbembe
well describes the arguments being put forth by intellectuals and ordinary people in Africa
to support their exclusive rights to carry out anthropological and historical research in their
own countries. For him, an "historicism" has hindered the explanation of Africa's past and
its present in relation to its future.36 He depicts two of its forms: "Afroradicalism," which is
flawed by a manipulative political opportunism, and "nativism." In the case of the former,
only autonomy, resistance, and emancipation can produce a legitimate, authentic African
discourse. As for the latter, there is a total reliance on the notion of a unified African identity
based on race. In consequence, three canonical historical moments are constructed: slavery,
colonization and apartheid. Afroradicalism and nativism, two sides of the same coin, are all
the rage in certain African-American intellectual circles, especially among the Afrocentrists.37
In South Africa a keen interest in history and its writing has emerged since the end of
Apartheid, bolstered by the experience of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This
Commission, as Jean Comaroff has described, gave rise to many different ways of thinking
about the past and about history.38 Along with interest in the heroic tale of the resistance
to Apartheid, mostly led by freedom fighters, a thirst for history has gripped many in South
Africa's popular circles, who are claiming their right to their own past. They harness this past
to multiple identities, some old, some new, some majestic, some ordinary. Several institu-
tions in South Africa are vehicles of this new history. First, there are the journalists of the
popular press and the talk shows. Next, the Pentecostal churches and the NGOs are acting
as the spokespersons of healing memories, real-life stories, and even confessional narratives.
Organic intellectuals offer "struggle tours" and a "counter-story" (sometimes invading pub-
lic life with a clamour that leads Comaroff to ask if anybody is really listening).39 Simon
Schama, who coined the term "performative history," especially lauds television history,
which he sees as contributing to the democratization of knowledge; he believes in the virtues
of history, which for hifn are liberty, empathy and community building.40 Yet here history
risks being privatized and reduced to consumer goods, such that a delocalized, media-driven
history is unfolding every day. Where does the local/native researcher place him- or herself
amidst all this noise? Although just as disoriented as their foreign-born counterparts, these
Black scholars continue to believe themselves to be innately knowledgeable about their so-

ciety by virtue of being born into it, and continue to claim the exclusive right to narrate
their pasts. Indeed some of them are effectively bogged down in an antiquated historicism;
instead of seizing history as a breeding-ground for the future, they wear it as a millstone
round their necks. As Mbembe argues, their thinking, whether they know it or not, is based
on a Manichean worldview.
I wish now to move forward to the second part of my reasoning, which I put forth
as the flip side to historicism. The seemingly contradictory syndrome, which at once places
a strain on, and provides an undeniable context for historicism and the writing of history
is "presentism." "Time marches on [...] the present is in command": this "contemporary
experience of time" clearly drives some Africans living in major cities.4 In the city, children
cannot be brought up in the same way they are in the village. The modern school system
carried out in a European language or in Arabic, is replacing the training of children in the
oral traditions or in the ways of the family.42 The inhabitants of modern cities are essentially
migrants. For those who were either required to or voluntarily left their villages for the
anonymous city, in order to improve their chances of moving up in society, the city provides
the best chance for them to create a present for themselves, perhaps even a future, but it
especially allows them to forget about their condition of being dominated.43 These migrants,
whoever they are, disrupt their social and intellectual development when they give up the
option to remain in the village where they would engage in a life-long learning of the oral
traditions. Their departure is synonymous with a kind of severing of ties that nothing-
neither tape-recorded memories requested from afar, nor irregular visits to One's village
of origin--can replace. Over 400 million Africans, more than half of the population of the
continent, live in the cities, where the rate of population growth is the highest in the world."
Moreover, it must be said that the village is no longer what it was, if indeed it ever real-
ly was what we have been made to believe it used to be. Difficult as it may be, one has further
to admit that the bucolic image of Africa belongs to the past. The hurried gait that is so typi-
cal of Western urbanites is now seen not only in the cities but also in the "new" African vil-
lage. The village, at least in the Sahel region, is a melting pot of migrants. Everyone in their
own way has either left the village or hopes to leave someday. Some parts of the Y61imane
District, one of the most isolated regions of Mali in the center of Soninke country, are more
in touch with the world news than are certain areas of Bamako. The migrants from Y61imane
invested in information technology in order to stay in touch with their family members who
remained behind.45 In the city, the new inhabitants do not completely discard their past, but
they tell themselves a history no longer like the one told in the village. Both the intellectual
means and the time to maintain that village history are lacking. What's more, the environ-
ment is not very accommodating. The past is transformed-as it always is-and they slowly
unlearn what the preceding generation would have liked to pass down to them. Yet here
one does not argue on the basis of history, as would be done in a book or in a lecture hail,
but rather on the basis of oral tales that provide an alternative-or a "consolation"46-when

THE OSMOSIS OF THE GAZES

one's powerlessness in the face of the present cannot be avoided. This omnipresence of the
present could also be called "presentism."
The weight of the past has some influence here, but one must get used to the fact
that the true dimension of the present, which dictates its own law, has to be accounted for.
Presentism influences the transmission of everything that has to do with history and anthro-
pology. This influence directly concerns the descendants of the inhabitants of the cities, who
someday will try to look back on what they will consider to be their own past. The example
offered by Narayan is that of second- or third-generation migrants who leave their country
of birth (the United States) to return to their parents' or grand-parents' country of origin
in search of knowledge.47 While the weight of "historicism" brings us closer to the past, in
a nostalgic way, the weight of "presentism" distances us from it and at the very least creates
another image of the past. Naturally each generation produces its own view of events, real or
otherwise, but rarely have their portraits clashed so much.
With his lively pen, Henige has always reminded us that no matter how much we be-
lieve in oral traditions, great care must be taken when we deal with texts, whether these be
oral texts from the start, texts written down based on oral sources, or actual written texts.48
This was his creed in the debate he had with Dierk Lange.49 Henige acknowledges that the
use of oral traditions as a source of history still clearly suffers from suspicions imposed by a
"Western cultural bias."'50 However, this in no way justifies exempting these traditions from
the type of analysis that written texts usually undergo.5 The author adds that it is probably
more interesting and more instructive to examine the conditions of the transformation of
the content of traditions than go on endlessly about whether or not they have changed. Still
he denounces any "tendency to subordinate the content of sources to their interpretation"
just as he railed against this tendency in the work of David William Cohen.12 It is in any case
obvious that partaking in the claim of a fully reliable African memory-as if such a thing ever
really existed-amounts to a denial of history for those very individuals so extolled. This
blindness may serve to bolster a certain myth-worshiping Afrocentrism, but it does nothing
for historical research.
The analysis of the effects of being so close to the field, and its consequences, is a
long-running story that has been studied indirectly by two French woman historians, Sophie
Dulucq and Colette Zytnicki. The African researcher's introspection is not at the center of
their investigation, but they bring up in passing the question of the relationship between the
"native researcher" and the "field" as seen by the colonial authorities.53 Studying the ques-
tion of "vernacular views" of history they have analyzed in detail the relationship between
historical truth and closeness to the field. According to certain colonial trends, the "natural"
closeness with the continent's past was a "guarantee of historical authenticity." The colonial
ethnographic literature, the rules of which were established between 1920 and 1930, was
spawned by the writings of the "&amp;amp;volu&amp;amp;s" (a largely Catholic, new class of French-educated
Africans) whom the journal Revue de l'Histoire des Colonies franfais rounded up to fill up

their columns.54 What resulted was an official version of history, and the list of authors is well
known. Here I am relying on Dulucq's and Zytnicki's valuable references to Yoro Dya'o,
Cheick Moussa Kamara, and Biram Cire Ba."s Here I cite one of their examples, that of Dim
Delobsom. He devoted a book to the Mossi Kingdoms, earning him the following enthusi-
astic praise from la Revue in 1933:
The main reason this book is so valuable is that it is the work of a qualified repre-
sentative of this civilization. Indeed, Mr. Dim Delobsom is himself a Naba, a Mossi
nobleman, raised in Ouagadougou and in Kayes, who became a French civil ser-
vant. [...] No other European account could be as valuable as this accurate view that
has been opened onto the interior life of this people [...].16
You would think you were reading Lowie.17 Dulucq and Zytnicki point out that al-
though the "natives" who work to build these large cities turn out to be indispensable they
still remain "subalterns." The "cultural translators" working for France seized the chance to
manipulate those who thought they were using them.8Someone who was seen as a lowly
informant turns out to be a major voice in the "grand narrative" of the pre-colonial and
colonial past. History, as it was told and recorded in writing by Western researchers, is now
more than ever caught in a big trap. The "informant"-an outdated and unfair concept that
Hastrup and others such as Ghasarian have suggested we get rid of-is somehow still central
to their thinking.59 Indigenous knowledge and colonial knowledge make up a hybrid entity,
which is manipulated by two partners.60
The inevitable linkage between positivist historians and these indigenous scholars calls
to mind the relationship between the anthropologist, who carries out research and writes
it up according to the "standards of Western learning," and the African scholar who speaks
and/or writes according to a "local approach to the past." This relationship goes way back,
and it hardly appears to have been modified by the profound transformations produced
in this context by independence movements, modernization, and education. Still change
has taken place at all levels, including among the scholars themselves. The development of
university teaching, specifically in the humanities and social sciences, has been significant in
sub Saharan Africa, in spite of the economic and political strain that the university systems
have endured. The number of local researchers gathering data according to Western or
Arabic-Muslim standards is on the rise.6' These scholars, who are keenly interested in local
knowledge, were and remain very open to other traditions such as those brought by Western
colonial explorations, jihads, and alliances or confrontations with local or distant neighbors.
The "colonial library" has always had its proponents and still serves as a model.
There are countless examples of historians and anthropologists who, like their fellow
villagers, have moved to the city. After the second, or at most the third, generation, what
do they still know about villages or about the knowledge-keepers who live there? In these
cases, to use Ouattara's terms, cultural proximity dissolves while social distance increases.02
Obviously, if the local knowledge-keepers also move to the city, then the spatial distance is

THE OSMOSIS OF THE GAZES

reduced, but nothing guarantees that their cultural distance will be also. Several intellectuals
living in rapidly growing African cities have effectively turned their backs on their type of
local knowledge. And of course the law of supply and demand remains king. Talented high
school or university students, yielding to well-intentioned family pressure, focus on training
in areas that will bring them better incomes, and not in our disciplines.
There are more and more people who through birth or because they were raised in the
city, within their own country or abroad, develop a relationship with local knowledge com-
pletely different from the one their relatives in the village have. The number of descendants
of African migrants to Europe returning to do field work is growing, reinforcing the "rever-
sal of otherness" and the "indigenization" of men and women in the field, to borrow words
from Copans.61 For them, sometimes just speaking the language of the country, getting to
know or reconnecting with relatives, understanding social relations, knowing how to behave
in a group, and striking up a casual, joking conversation with their cousins or relatives, turns
out to be very difficult."
The gaze of the native anthropologist/historian on his own turf turns out to be multi-
centered. The path taken by the researcher, who is schooled abroad and uses university
methods, goes a long way towards explaining this. In the same way, the path taken by the
migrant and ordinary city-dweller has transformed their gaze. The foray into the university
arena of these intellectuals, and the theoretical issues that emerge from it, are rapidly being
appropriated in India and in the United States.
As a factor in the development of southeast Asian studies between 1950 and 1990 in
the United States, Benedict Anderson tightly points to the growth of both a university and a
non-university intelligentsia.65 Based on this observation, Baud asserts that Latin America is
the only region of the world that has been engaged in a continuous, complex, and conflictual
intellectual dialogue with the Western intellectual tradition since the nineteenth century.
This dialogue has involved a transnational group of intellectuals, some of whom come from
Latin America but who now live in the United States. These researchers naturally study their
countries of origin. Even though the North/South researcher dichotomy is hardly sufficient
on its own, it is still possible to map out how they oppose one another.
Daniel Mato has dedicated a series of articles to the imbalance that Walter Mignolo
quickly labeled the suburbanization of South American researchers.66 Mato deplores the fact
that colleagues from the southern continent are reduced to the rank of lowly informants by
their northern colleagues, who hand out their usual acknowledgements in footnotes.67 The
disdain with regard to the research carried out in the South has been brought to light by
critics of the so-called American post- and anti-colonial historians such as the eminent Van
Young.68 The latter has suggested (in a somewhat arrogant way) that the works of Latin
American scholars might turn out to be enlightening even though they still rely somewhat
on traditional ethnography. The North-American scientific discourse currently in vogue in-
tegrates data gathered by colleagues in the South, finding there an irreplaceable source of

inspiration. Martin Barbero and many others are up in arms about their northern colleagues
and emphasize southerners' ideas already existed long before they were "discovered" by
cultural studies.69 The belief persisted that any theory developed would interest the public
only if it was taken up by recognized journals and book publishers in the North.7° Sanjay
Subrahmanyam, citing Eaton, correctly points to the necessary conformity to the "set of
issues imposed by the new hegemony," that of American university presses.7' Even if I find
Eaton's hegemonic analysis to be somewhat simplistic, I readily agree with this comment,
which could apply to almost all of the major book publishers.
The African intellectual tradition tied to the West is clearly not as old and not as well
articulated as the one in Latin America, but many of the same problems criticized in the
Americas can be found here in Africa. Both are related to the issue of distance between the
researcher and the object of study, and to otherness, which I claim is relational, not national
or ethnic. Let us now step back into history and anthropology to take a look at a well-
established dogma.
The Dogma of Distance
The eminent scholar Fritz Kramer draws our attention to something he has observed as
far back as the work of Adolf Bastian, the father of German museology in the nineteenth
century.72 The colonial distance, writes Kramer, ensures that the ethnographer's otherness
will be transformed into positive knowledge that is useful to the social technology of the
colonial administration. Kramer's analysis is still valid. Indeed, both ethnographers and their
descendants, ethnologists and anthropologists, are proud of this distance that allows them
to interpret observed reality according to a philological model that a researcher carefilly
applies to the Other.73
According to Marc Auge, "anthropology is first defined as the study of distant societ-
ies in the present: the difference that it seeks to study was originally located in space, not
in time."74 This is how the dogma of distance was founded. It was made to differentiate
and set up a hierarchy, in line with the comfortable dichotomy that our ethnographer and
ethnologist forebears worked so hard to define. Take, for example, the American tradition
represented by Herskovits, which consisted of discouraging African American students from
carrying out research in sub Saharan Africa on the grounds that they would be subjective
since they were not distant enough from their subject.71 Naturally, at that time, field research
on "natives" was the exclusive domain of the middle class white male.
How do we then define the "native" in today's context? Narayan, referring to
Appadurai, provides a good definition of the concept of "nativism" with its lingering no-
tions of authenticity and purity.76 The native is attached to a geographical location, to a
place. He is assumed to be free of any contamination, still and pure, and by his very nature
available to the foreigner, his opposite. The society from which the native comes is one single

THE OSMOSIS OF THE GAZES

homogenous entity, as Ouattara has so astutely pointed oUt.77 Narayan applies this general
characterization of the native to the local anthropologist.78 The native then means anybody
acting from within, whatever their identity or the path they have taken. Excluded from the
category are other anthropologists, including those who have spent their lives navigating the
two different worlds, even those who are more comfortable in their adopted country than in
the land of their birth. Copans provides some very apt words with regard to this sub-class to
describe the ethnologist as being split into two, and sometimes three, identities-"Western
foreigner," "national foreigner" (in the sociological sense) and "native operator."79
When we ignore what is so obvious, we create an illusion of distance that results in two
very distinct worlds. Many anthropologists have worked against this binary vision by sys-
tematically analyzing the relationship between the investigator and the investigated. Michael
Jackson situates the complicity between the two actors at the heart of his analysis and goes
so far as to suggest in his method that the break with "traditional empiricism," and its sharp
divide between the "observed" and the "observer," should be called "radical empiricism."180
Spittler supports Jackson's method, but emphasizes his own identity as an anthropologist
who questions, writes down, records and classifies.8' Gupta and Ferguson put forth a flexible
understanding of the researcher's identity.82 Far from being something that is established
once and for all (middle-class white, for example), it is subjected to a strategic development
that stems from the researcher's work itself.
I do not intend to rehash all of these analyses because my interest and my intentions
are altogether different.83 I wish to know what attitudes Western researchers have displayed
when using the tools of anthropology and/or of oral history to study their own societies.
How do they handle the theme of distance that has been established as an ideology at the
founding of ethnology?
Karl-Heinz Kohl aptly defines the problem by bringing up the concept of relational
otherness (die relationale Fremdheit).84 Today, anthropologists are focusing as much on
Western societies as they are on foreigners in a foreign land. Given this new focus, an an-
thropologist would need to step back from his own culture, which he previously believed
he knew very well. This relational otherness takes on the quality of a methodological prin-
ciple, which speaks well for the discipline. Thanks to the tools of social network analysis,
anthropology was able to move into a new field of study, that of Western institutions,5
Anthropologists also got their hands on new empirical objects such as corporations, hos-
pitals, subway systems, the inner-city as well as suburban neighborhoods. All of these are
inscribed within the same space studied by sociologists of modern Europe.6 The objective
of the discipline is being transformed as it develops87 Anthropology sets as its primary goal
the "way others conceive of the relationship between themselves and others: the first other-
ness (that of those who are studied by the anthropologist) begins With the anthropologists
themselves and is not necessarily related to ethnicity or nationality. Indeed, it can stem from
their social class, profession, or place of residence."88

This brings us to the approach taken by Abeles, who writes that "the distance of an-
thropology is not so much a quality of the object as it is a quality of the approach, whether it
is a matter of reducing it in a distant land or introducing it in a local site."89 Why, I wonder,
does this distancing have to serve as the foundation on which we base the analytical capac-
ity of anthropology? Why does it constitute the essence of the distinction we make between
ourselves and our colleagues in the social sciences? I ask myself, challenging to Irene Bellier's
prescription, why the social distance constructed between anthropology and its research
object must be the foundation of its distinction from the other social sciences.90 How can
this be when the same social distance exists between the sociologist and his object, be it the
working class or the financial sector? Why must the discipline of anthropology continue to
wear the notion of distance like an old stain that won't wash out?
Roland Girder strongly advises his European sociologist colleagues to study ethnology
if they wish to be caught by surprise on their own turf, within their own society.9' According
to him otherness, a founding principal of anthropology, is just as valid in sociology, since in
today's world migrants are no longer an epiphenomenon. He advises sociologists to start
with the postulate of the otherness of the surrounding world in order to be surprised, as
if encountering a stranger. The emotion (Ergriffenheit), Leo Frobenius' favorite term, will
be their reward.92 It is important to point out that sociology studies the same migrants that
interest specialists of cultural anthropology (Kulturanthropologie), especially in Germany,
and they also resort to the same methods as those deployed by anthropologists and ethnolo-
gists.93
The American anthropologist Lloyd Warner was a pioneer in the reversal of the eth-
nological gaze.94 After a lengthy stay doing field work in Australia, he learned there to focus
on the Other before coming back to turn his gaze towards a small town in the Midwest.95
This is how urban studies was born and then practiced by one of the founders of the Chicago
School, a true convert.96 On the other hand, American researchers in the humanities and
social sciences, and later those of other countries, called into question the research they did
on their own society. James Clifford points out the new clarification and energy that char-
acterize the re-emergence of cultural criticism within the discipline. American researchers
are turning their gaze towards biology and physics laboratories as well as new urban com-
munities and problematic traditional identities.97 Clifford concludes that ethnography is en-
croaching on areas that for a long time belonged to sociology, and is rediscovering otherness
and difference in the very heart of Western cultures.98 James Spradley is certainly one of the
best known thinkers with respect to the reversal of the gaze, due to his classical work on the
methodology of field work and also because of the extensive work he did on employees and
clients of bars.99 Some anthropologists and sociologists have redirected their focus towards
their own societies after spending several years developing field work experiences abroad,
especially in Africa.t°°

THE OSMOSIS OF THE GAZES

It was within this context that the Institut International Transcultura (Transcultura
International Institute) was founded. This is an international university network that brings
together European institutions (University of Paris VII, University of Bologna, University
of Madrid), Chinese institutions (Tsinghua University in Beijing, the Academy of Social
Sciences), Indian institutions (Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, University
of Nehru in Dehli), Iranian institutions (University of Teheran) and African institutions
(Institute for Humanities and Social Sciences [Institut des Sciences humaines] in Bamako,
Mali). Transcultura was created in 1988 during the 900th anniversary celebration of the
University of Bologna. However, back in 1982 Alain le Pichon, the French co-founder, had,
along with some African researchers, already initiated the "Program in the Ethnology of
France by Researchers from the Third World" following the "International Colloquium on
Oral Tradition Cultures" held in Brest.'0' The wishes of N'Djehoha and Diallo have been
slow to be carried out, because so few African researchers have actually practiced "reverse
ethnology" as it is defined by these two authors.12 The researchers who were invited at that
time to carry out projects in the rural areas of France were given small, limited projects to
work on. Jean Copans rightly points out that these projects are destined to fail since the
researchers they bring together all rely on the same patterns of thought that they are seeking
to differentiate artificially.'03 What lies ahead for Transcultura at a time when French anthro-
pologists are being defined by their choice to ignore the contributions of other nations to
French ethnology? After reading several works written by French anthropologists, Copans
asks "why ethnology in France has to reduce itself to French ethnology from France?'04
The Transcultura Institute is questioning a certain practice in anthropology that the
champions of postmodern anthropology are also vigorously challenging. For Clifford, Gupta
and Ferguson, the time has come to move away from field anthropology carried out by a
white male in an exotic land towards a "decolonized anthropology" that espouses at best
the diverse contours of a world that is "deterritorialized" and "interconnected," moving past
the exoticization of the conventional anthropological field.'5 In this way we can open the
ground to community members who have traditionally been the anthropologists' objects
of study. Amselle highlights two essential contradictions within the postmodern project: 1)
anthropologists, every last one of them, rely on the same categories and utilize a common
"corpus of knowledge"; and 2) postmodern anthropologists are fueling generous plans to
let the natives have their say in the name of political correctness.06 While anthropologists
are trying to deconstruct field anthropology as a mechanism that participates in the West's
domination of the rest of the world, the theory of globalization implicitly differentiates be-
tween primitive and modern societies and posits that modern societies will inundate primi-
tive ones.'07 How then can we provide even a little bit of autonomy for the native researchers
in the field?
With the passage of time, Westerners will not be the only ones doing research, but

the "researcher's" society will be subjected to the curiosity of the Other. The question of
"distance" will everywhere continue to gnaw, since the anthropologist will still be aware that
he is neither the homeless person,108 nor the trader'09 and even less so the building worker"0
that he studies. If we think that proximity provides objectivity, then we fall back into the
same type of reasoning that characterizes the founders of the discipline.
Let us take a closer look at Jean Copans' argument with regard to distance, a word
the usefulness of which I question."' Let's first take a look at the actors involved. The mi-
grants, the new city dwellers, develop over time, and as a result of the transformation of
their identity, a plural and multi-centered gaze. This differs from the "univocity of the gaze"
of those who stayed in the village and are more or less sheltered from the major upheavals
experienced in the city. This strong "reversal of alterities," as the situation of the migrants is
called, enriches the subject's experience, and as a result strengthens the discipline. Copans
refers to the research project that Neveu carried out on the Bangladeshi inhabitants of a
London neighborhood. Neveu studies the Bangladeshi in their "own land" in Bangladesh,
but he also studies them in London."2 Copans rightly highlights "this back and forth, these
turnabouts and decenterings, these multiple distancings or, on the other hand, these recon-
nections that the anthropologist undergoes with his object," and points out that they "allow
him to globalize, but also to localize [...] the immigrants who come from a specific city in
Bangladesh." The phenomenon of distance becomes only one facet among many others and
the anthropological obsession with it fades away.
The ethnologist is split into two or three different identities that co-exist and observe
one another: the "Western foreigner," the "national foreigner," and the "native operator.""'3
Now this splitting assumes a much greater importance. The author likens this splittage to
spirals that are transformed into spheres that spin inside one another as in a model of the
solar system. I heartily endorse this splendid metaphor but with just one clarification. It is
an indisputable fact that the gazes of the different actors in the field are continually relaying
one another, even "observing one another," but most importantly, these gazes blend in with
those of the locals being interviewed, all the while mutually influencing one another."14 The
multiple, intertwined identities of the university researchers depend on them to come back
to life in the field.
The multi-centered dimension introduced by the actors, whether they are Bangladeshis
or immigrants who themselves have become researchers, is of major importance, and it be-
hooves us to take it seriously. I am thinking, for example, of the deep motivation that drives
researchers towards faraway places, towards the Other. Beyond the phenomenon of distance
itself, this motivation says a lot more about how distance is conquered or, on the contrary,
reinforced. Jean-Loup Amselle provides a good example of this in his latest book when he
describes how he ended up going to Mali in search of the traders of the savanna."5 W  need
to think more about the reasons that weave themselves between us and our object in order
to better understand the conditions under which we act. It is important that with time our

THE OSMOSIS OF THE GAZES

"language impairment" not be allowed to reduce this "object" into lowly objects, because
these are after all our interlocutors, our informants.16
The Hunting Metaphor
Malinowski described the ethnographer's attitude toward his research object in the follow-
ing way: "But the ethnographer has not only to spread his nets at the right place, and wait
for what will fall into it. He must be an active huntsman and drive his quarry into them and
follow it up to its most inaccessible lairs.""7 The hunting horn has sounded. This is how
Malinowski defined what an ethnologist is: a man of action who must not only lie in wait,
but must also pursue these indigenous people, these natives and informants, to their remot-
est hiding places. The informant is also like a spring where the researcher goes to sate his
thirst. Whether or not one it in quotation marks, the informant still refers to the one who
tells things to the Other. While his questioner champs at the bit with desire to learn, he may
or may not deliver the expected product."8 David Henige has written words in this regard
that are scathing but utterly accurate: "If nothing else, fieldwork is exploitation. The histo-
rian gains experience, raw materials, and a start on a life of scholarship. The interviewees, if
nothing else, gain a new perspective of ingratitude, a place in bibliographies and, if lucky in
prefaces. This is to put it harshly, but it is not to put it too harshly.""119
The result for the informant is a life-long status of subalternity, synonymous with a
failure to qualify-what Narayan rightly calls the never-qualified.20
To be sure this relationship between the assistant and the interlocutor has now been
written about extensively. Karl-Heinz Kohl wrote an article about dialogical anthropology
in which he criticizes anthropologists who don't feel guilty about how they exploit their
informants.'21 The type of person whose ideal is a "hermeneutical fusion of horizons" (that
of the anthropologist and that of the informant), reminiscent of Gadamer, is harboring illu-
sions. The fictitious concept of dialogue is an attempt to oversimplify a multivocal process.
Ivo Strecker engages this fiction when he writes about how he and Baldambe, his Ethiopian
collaborator, called each other misso, which means hunting friends. Their game was not to
kill animals, but rather the "lies" of other people. In the presence of potential interlocutors,
Baldambe, would say to his anthropologist partner: "[...] hunting friend, the elders have just
arrived, let's get their lies." The "friend" joins in-again the hunting horn has sounded!
Karl-Heinz Kohl however rightly emphasizes the inequality of the relationship. He
talks to this friend about all kinds of things on a daily basis; however, as soon as it is time to
record an interview and the tape recorder is on the table, the friend is transformed into an
informant.122 Kohi straightens up and adapts to the context about which he spontaneously
claims, "This is science!" It is this asymmetrical relationship that leads Sylvie Faizang to favor
the standard term "informant" over the word "interiocutor," as she is convinced that use of
the latter constitutes pure hypocrisy.23 Copans emphasizes the complexity of the conversa-

tion; according to him, if discipline is dialogical between the informant and the anthropolo-
gist, then it must also be so for anthropologists among themselves.24
In fieldwork it is always the ethnographer, in an act of "epistemological charity," to
borrow an expression from Ghasarian, who lets the Other have his say, but he also jeal-
ously reserves the last word for himself.125 After all, he is the one who chooses the tools for
research, the publishing language, the one who composes and signs the work. What does
it matter if there exists, through charity, a co-author?26 Furthermore, as Johannes Fabian
has underscored, is it really possible to represent this field dialogue with a transcription or
transposition?27 What remains of the shared work? For Hastrup, resorting to the use of na-
tive voices is not a solution to the epistemological crisis in anthropology.28 The guilt-ridden
researcher has two problems: the problem of the individual on whom he often depends, and
the problem of the field. As Kohl has written, the hunting tradition that has influenced this
term "field" has colonial origins. How do we go from the game we want to hunt, towards
the individual before whom we are sometimes no more than a lowly student in the purest
Socratic tradition?29
Informants often write up regular reports that are sent through the mail or delivered
personally. They are the force behind the glorious pioneers of the discipline. Franz Boas said
that the material collected by the native bears "the immeasurable advantage of truth, reveal-
ing authentically and accurately the elusive thoughts and feelings of the native."110 Local
actors, the only ones capable of revealing the secrets of the natives, were admitted into the
professionals' inner circles, but only as their instruments.'3'
Even today informants continue to please a new generation of researchers by sending
letters, making phone calls and composing email messages, thus allowing them to spend
more time in their offices or in the city instead of heading out along paths in the "field"
which are getting more and more dangerous. This trend is proportional to the rank and age
of the researcher. At the height of his career, his "obligations" associated with mentoring,
teaching and administrative responsibilities cut him off slowly but surely from the field. All
researchers partake of the scavengers' tradition, the tradition of those who collect things. As
time goes by, every one of us accumulates a more or less adequate "war chest" on which to
reflect and from which we extract "the philosophy of things." During this time the so-called
researcher, if he's been lucky, has trained a faithful assistant who is willing to work remotely
on the ground, under orders from his superior.
I hope to have adequately conveyed here the complexity of the native researcher's iden-
tity. It is that of a man or a woman from the big city with a multi-centered gaze. Whoever he
or she is, they have left their families to get training elsewhere, in the manner of Diawara or
of Ouattara.132 They espouse another form of life and become a more complex whole. A fun-
damental difference arises, the scientific method, a synonym of distancing that the researcher
introduces into the field. Both Diawara and Ouattara had to comply with the principle of
small talk with the "elders" to take advantage of moments when they would let down their

guard. Siliman Tunkara, an octogenarian, related the following in 1982 when I asked him
to tell me the story of the royal servants of Jaara: "Oh! It's been such a long time since I
last talked about that. There are no more ears to listen to my words, these words that are of
no importance!"'33 Even if Siliman had proceeded to tell me everything, his point of view
would have been different from that of the researcher. At the same time it would not have
been the "native view of the past," which is all the more illusory as the world shrinks and
the native researcher himself is constantly reminded of his otherness by his family members.
"Who are you?" Other researchers in other parts of the world say the same thing.
Aguilar and Messerschmidt accurately described the heterogeneity of cultures and the
diversity of human societies.'34 Along the same lines, Kirin Narayan analyzes what she calls
her "multiplex identity."'35 She is the daughter of a (South Asian) Indian man who left
to study in the United States where he married her future mother. The mother was born
of a German woman who had married an American. Narayan is thus a German-Indian-
American. She had also been shaped by Nasik, the small town where her father was born,
which determined her identity after she arrived there to carry out research on oral traditions.
Her work on women's songs also led her regularly to Kangra, a village in the foothills of the
Himalayas, where her mother had chosen to reside. The local interlocutors expected that
this young, unmarried woman would behave in a dignified manner, that is, according to
the local customs. She was considered to be both a native, because of the village where her
mother lived, and an Indian from Bombay. One old woman, learning that Narayan did not
belong to the ethnic group of the local shepherds, called the Gabbi, simply considered her
as a foreigner. Other similar cases could be mentioned.36 The elderly sociologist Mysore N.
Srinivas was subjected to the same ambivalence, and was besieged with questions when he
returned to his village after his studies at Oxford in the 1940s.'17
Nonetheless, let me put two dampers on Narayan's otherwise relevant observations.
First, the author devotes her research exclusively to anthropology. For my part, I have opened
the topic up to historians-I travelled through the Sahel in this capacity-and the number of
historians of Africa fully warrants such inclusivity.'38 It also seems to me that Narayan does
not fully appreciate the value of her own role as an actress, or that of the other intellectuals
cited here. At issue is a fluid identity but one which we manipulate. To be satisfied with an
unbridled flexibility of identity, subject to the tides, is to forget that the very strength of the
tides, the will to unleash them, belongs to us. If any native in India or in Africa can feel like
Narayan or I have, it is not a given that he or she will react as we did. Taking seriously this
ability to act and to react in an autonomous way, we may disbelieve the illusion of a hyper-
relativism in which all possibilities are valid at the same time.
We are the products of an historical process: to be born somewhere, to come from
such and such family. But our interactions and our lives with our partners in the field, our
fostering of relationships that are more or less profound, is the result of initiatives taken by

77

one side (us) or the other (our partners). In addition to being products, we are also at the
same time the driving force of an historical process that we construct together.
Toward an Intellectual History of Africa
The analysis of native views of the past and their relationship with the colonizer is part of
"the cultural history of colonization" and of "the history of science."139 Along the same
lines, analyzing the relationships of local intellectuals in our own time is part of the history
of history and the history of anthropology, which in turn belong, as Lynette Schumaker
reminds us, to the history of science.40 Copans makes a timely observation when he calls
"for conducting an historical anthropology of our theories and an ethnoscience of our prac-
tices.'4' He emphasizes the need to restore the anthropological dimension to the produc-
tion of knowledge. In the same way, Jean-Loup Amselle observes post-colonial intellectual
production, and most notably subalternist production throughout the world, from an his-
torical and epistemological perspective.'42
I have attempted in my own way to look back on the diverse and various forms of the
"disadvantage of being one of the locals." Twenty five years are indeed insignificant in rela-
tion to the past of an entire people, or better yet of a continent which is coming to terms
with the West and with its own history. However, the speed with which events are passing
us by requires us to pause and question the nature of scientific discourse. While doing this, I
had to face the ingratitude of my return to myself as well as the fear of this return. This fear
is caused by more than the methodological difficulty. There is the fear of discovering oneself
in the fullest of senses. There is the feeling of nakedness, from pinpointing one's own weak-
nesses. There is the terror stemming from that nakedness, and of leaving oneself wide open
to criticism from other disciplines.
Anthropology and oral history, which necessarily deal with the non-western world,
were founded on the dogma of distance. This has been carefully maintained by the natives of
these civilizations as well as by the foreigners. The ethnologist of yesteryear based his scien-
tific objectivity on his ability to remain at a distance from those that he observed. The task is
now more complicated for both of them, for the foreign-born researcher as well as the native
ones, since the science that gave rise to distance is now being practiced among the latter on
their own turf. Furthermore the "foreigner" is also now "at home" everywhere he goes, an
aspect of globalization. Thus a new set of conditions for defining otherness is drawn up. The
dogma of otherness cannot therefore be the basis of a discipline. In the same way, proximity,
which reverses the dogma but yet relies on it, is also no longer a valid commendation.
It appears then to be of the utmost importance to update our investigative methods.
I feel no temptation to clalm that I have developed new quantifiable instruments, but it is
laudable to concentrate on teaching how to process materials collected in order to extract
from them a scientific text. In order to do this, one must obviously go into the field, whether

this is Germany or Mal. And we must take time to be in the field if we do not wish slowly
and definitively to throw dirt over these disciplines.
At the beginning of ethnology there was a specific gaze, that of the ethnologist, and
it was the only one that counted. I have shown the relativity of nativeness and the nature of
carrying out research specifically because one is a foreigner. Many gazes and many skills are
at work. From this diversity come many angles on the same reality observed and sometimes
lived. The multicentered and particular gaze of each of these two observers is by definition
inadequate to account for this complexity, so several gazes and several points of view are
necessary. The osmosis of gazes allows us to better define the object of analysis. The gaze is
not just a glance at the other, however sharp it may be. It is the expression of an effort sur-
rounding the investigative method that underlies the anthropologist's three requirements,
which I gladly hold out to historians who work in the field: the choice of one's field, the
implementation of a method, and the construction of the object.43

37. Mathole Motshekga, director of the Kara Heritage Institute in South Africa, is one of the most
impassioned spokespersons for Afrocentrism. He firmly believes that the European Renaissance
was based on "African knowledge." Two key principles of the cosmology of Mapungubwe were
in his view appropriated by Europe and served as a foundation for the metaphysics of Newton
and Einstein. For these specific reasons, Africa does not have to import social and moral value
systems such as human rights; see his "Indigenous Knowledge's Systems in the African Century,"
paper presented at the Black Management Forum 30th Anniversary Annual Conference, Durban,

118. Anthropology has provided some good examples, such as that of the French researcher Marcel
Griaule and of Ogotemmeli, the old Dogon hunter from the French Sudan. After his conversation
with this great scholar, Griaule published in 1948 Dieu d'eau (Conversation with Ogotemmli
[1965]), which became a classical text in the discipline. On the German side, Ivo Strecker and
his "hunting friend" Baldambe seem to follow to a similar pattern, in a different colonial context
and under a guru-apprentice relationship linking the German to the Ethiopian. One day Strecker
showed Baldambe the picture of Ogotemmli on the cover of Dieu d'eau and compared him to the
elderly Dogon. Baldambe thought the comparison was funny and mimicked the posture of the old
man sitting with his hands crossed on his forehead; Ivo Strecker, "'Our Good Fortune Brought Us

the structure of the final text. Michel Agier has these very apt words on the subject of the fate that
awaits the collaboration between the anthropologist and his interlocutor. For Agier, the attemps

PROMISCUOUS TRANSLATION: WORKING THE WORD AT ANTANANARIVO

Promiscuous Translation: Working
the Word at Antananarivo
PIER M. LARSON, DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY
A missionary will acquire great honour to himself who translates
the New Testament or the whole Bible into the language of the heathen.'
I
ne of the Reformation's lasting impacts on the intellectual lives of Protestant
communities was its call for direct access to the Word of God in vernaculars.
Literacy and scriptural translation typified Protestantism and also its mission-
ary endeavors in the age of empire. Both biblical translation and reading were
considered prerequisite to a personal, proper knowledge of God. And both also emerged as
cornerstones of the theology and practice of British Evangelicalism. Postulating the "suffi-
ciency of the Scriptures, for the instruction and consolation, the establishment and maturity
of the Christian character," many nineteenth-century British Evangelicals developed a keen
interest in schools, literacy, translation, and reading publics.2 Many evangelists working the
spiritual fields of Britain and its empire were informed by these preoccupations. The estab-
lishment of schools for instructing youth in the three Rs, for example, was an important
evangelistic strategy of the London Missionary Society (LMS), one of the several foreign
Evangelical mission enterprises founded in late eighteenth-century Britain. The "honor" of
biblical translation into vernaculars was another.
Teaching youth to read, write, and count was impressed on missionaries-in-training
at the LMS's theological school in Gosport, Hampshire, just across the bustling bay from
the city of Portsmouth. Robert Moffat had passed through this institution on his way to
Southern Africa. A copy of his course notes allows us to appreciate the nature of the train-
ing offered there to would-be foreign missionaries. The earliest LMS evangelists bound for
Madagascar-David Jones, Thomas Bevan, and David Griffiths-also studied at Gosport.

PIER M. LARSON

Headmaster David Bogue lectured aspiring evangelists that schools were the foundation of
successful evangelization. Institutions for the study of the three Rs, in his view, were "chiefly
for the rising generation" and that in evangelical strategy "children [should be] made the
teachers of their parents and will convey to them many valuable ideas." Through the dis-
semination of such "valuable ideas," Bogue reasoned, "the influence of the Pagan Hierarchy
will be... greatly diminished and perhaps destroyed."3
For Bogue, then, youthful literacy was a particularly efficacious means of Christian
evangelization with the capacity to transform heathen societies from within, and by means
of their demographic base. Sacred literature translated into vernaculars, the reasoning went,
could be read out loud or recited in memory by literate children to their unlettered, unen-
lightened elders. In this plan, children would be heathenism's Trojan horse. Bogue's theory
of youth-based evangelism seldom explained actual patterns of conversion to Christianity in
nineteenth-century Africa, including Madagascar. But youth were useful teachers of and col-
laborators with many missionaries. Literacy, youth, and translation formed a trinity of preoc-
cupation within many British missions with generational implications for the cultural work
of empire. Literacy and translation, therefore, form salient themes in the history of youth
and generation in certain parts of Africa, as they do also in religious and social history more
broadly.
Curious, then, that so little of the historiography of Christianity in Africa produced
since the publication in 1948 of Bengt Sundkler's Bantu Prophets in South Africa actually
examines in detail early projects in vernacular literacy or biblical translation, and especially
the role of youth in them. Writing in 1985 at the apex of historians' interest in what was
then called oral historiography, Jon Janzen found remarkable the virtual absence of studies
about literacy and African Christianity.4 Only in recent years have scholars begun to turn
their attention from social and theological issues in African religious history toward more
intellectual ones and in a deliberate way to plumb the many implications of literacy in African
thought and practice.
Lamin Sanneh, for example, has argued that biblical translation into vernaculars in-
volved a "radical indigenization" that distinguished Protestant missionaries from colonial
administrators and Christian evangelism from Islam's preoccupation with Arabic as a lingua
franca (for Sanneh these distinctions were beneficial). A plethora of new studies explore the
uses of vernacular literacy in everyday contexts of the past and also along fractures of politi-
cal conflict, investigating how individuals and corporate groups constructed identities and
arguments through writing and translation, or how African composers innovated with the
many textual genres available to them. Others have probed the production, transformation,
and circulation of evangelical texts, mostly within twentieth-century British empire and on
its fringes, tracing out both an international history of the book and the personal utilities of
reading and writing in twentieth-century lives.5

PROMISCUOUS TRANSLATION: WORKING THE WORD AT ANTANANARIVO

The recent efflorescence of studies in popular literacy and its uses in twentieth-century
Africa has brought us well along the road to appreciating some of the implications of the
three Rs in the lives of certain Africans over the last century. Still, little attention has been
directed to originary processes of literacy acquisition and vernacular textual production,
especially during the nineteenth century. Most studies of literacy today assume an existing
system of reading and writing as a backdrop to personalized or social experiments in the
written word, and most concern the twentieth century.6
The nitty-gritty business of creating orthographies and fashioning early textual transla-
tions in African speech often set foreigners and their students into a tangle of reflexive intel-
lectual and social relationships. Their complexity and messiness belie the way Evangelical
missionaries tended to interpret the world in their published writings: as the confrontation
of unmistakably disparate categories ofAfroheathen and Eurochristian. Scriptural translation
typically required European clerics and African colleague translators to struggle with each
others' tongues and intellectual outlooks, and to place their mutually constituted knowledge
into the service of textual and semantic transformation, a point Derek Peterson has empha-
sized in his study of the stakes in the debates over competing alphabets for Kikuyu texts in
twentieth-century Kenya. When it came to biblical translation, missionaries typically claimed,
as they did in Madagascar, to have translated the Christian scriptures in a straightforward
way directly out of classical Mediterranean languages into African vernaculars, representing
themselves as the primary cultural and intellectual brokers between Eurochristianity and the
languages of Africanity.
But matters of language acquisition and the production and conversion of texts are
rarely so straightforward as such bold and simplistic claims suggest. Reciprocal acquisition
of mother tongues, experiments in orthography, creative efforts at generating biblical vo-
cabulary, and multiple takes at textual translation and revision formed the base work of many
Protestant missions to Africa and elsewhere.7 And these intellectually and socially promiscu-
ous interactions, in turn, brought Africans and envoys from Europe into relationships that
confound both clear-cut claims to authorship and tidy categories of teacher and taught. In
this essay, I investigate the foundations of Roman-alphabet letters in highland Madagascar in
the interactions of slaves, students, and missionaries. The focus here is on language transac-
tions between missionaries and their enslaved interpreters, on the one hand, and on those
within the royal-LMS schools of Antananarivo between late 1820 and about mid-1824, on
the other. My concern is how these transactions helped to shape biblical translation and the
wider growth of literacy.
Rapid developments in reading, writing, and translation in highland Madagascar of the
early nineteenth century are typically explained in hagiographic fashion, with reference to
the unique intelligence, training, and dedication of several British men. Missionaries' actions
and their writings, however, reveai a complex co-authorship of scriptural translations that
foreign evangelists often strategically denied or concealed from audiences in Britain. The

archive casts doubt on the way the story of biblical translation is typically told in Madagascar
and challenges us to examine experiments in early African literacy with an eye to the several
implications of the persons involved in translation projects and the sequence of procedures
employed in the process.
II
Perhaps no Evangelical mission in the early nineteenth century was as successful in its liter-
ate objectives as that of the LMS's mission to a kingdom in highland Madagascar, a place
known as Imerina. The mission society's first period of toil in Imerina during the early 1820s
was staffed by three independently thinking and excessively feuding Nonconformist minis-
ters-two Welshmen and an Englishman-together with their wives, and a number of arti-
sanal auxiliaries who, along with later-arriving missionaries, drifted in and out of the island
over the years.8 With the enthusiastic assistance of their patron, King Radama of Imerina,
British missionaries early dedicated themselves to the task of teaching small groups of urban
children to read and write, and shortly thereafter set the youth to the foundational task of
converting scriptures and other sacred literatures into the vernacular.
The results were impressive. Within eight years of their arrival, by June 1828, LMS
missionaries and their first students were managing some thirty schools with an enrollment
of over 5,200 students.9 By March of 1830 Nonconformist schoolmasters and their as-
sistants had completed and published a vernacular New Testament of which they quickly
circulated some 5,000 copies to novice and by all accounts avid readers. The entire Christian
scriptures in King Radama's tongue issued from the LMS press at Antananarivo in 1835,
the first complete Bible translated into an African idiom in the context of western mission.'0
Between 1827 and the departure of the last LMS missionaries from Imerina in mid-1836,
well more than 100,000 copies of individual and collated books of sacred scripture, religious
tracts, primers, spelling books, and ecclesiastical readers had been printed and distributed
from the mission press in Antananarivo. Schools for children continued to fimction in the
absence of the missionaries, and many adults began to acquire the art of reading from youth
who had passed through them. By 1840 as many as 25,000 highland Malagasy had gained
some experience in reading and writing their language in the Roman alphabet, or some five
percent of the population of Imerina." What accounts for the rapidity and success of both
literacy training and scriptural translation in early nineteenth-century Madagascar?
The first Evangelical missionary to arrive at Antananarivo, David Jones, acquired some
knowledge of Malagasy speechways during his two years of peregrinations about the west-
ern Indian Ocean prior to his arrival in highland Madagascar. Malagasy was second as a
contact language only to French at the Mascarenes, for example, and we know that Jones

PROMIScuous TRANSLATION: WORKING THE WORD AT ANTANANARIVO

conversed with Malagasy speaking slaves on Mauritian sugar estates and studied publica-
tions and manuscripts in Malagasy speech varieties previously compiled by Catholic mis-
sionaries and administrators in the colonial islands.12 But more specifically, for nearly two
years before his arrival at Antananarivo, Jones enjoyed the services of an enslaved interpreter
named Joseph. Joseph was a "Government Black" (see below) of Malagasy origin who had
been allocated to the use of the missionary in 1818 by the governor of Mauritius.3 Slaves
are sparingly-mentioned in missionaries' communications with the LMS headquarters in
London, but they were indispensable to the earliest evangelizing efforts of LMS personnel,
which required translation services. Recourse to native translators was "very desirable at first,
before [one] can learn the language," David Bogue had lectured his missionary students at
Gosport.14 Those instructions were heeded by Jones, with the real-life twist that his inter-
preter was to be a slave adept at working among the principle languages of the islands of the
western Indian Ocean (French and Malagasy).
Most politically subaltern Malagasy of slave and free status at colonial Mauritius were
multilingual and comprised a valuable resource to Europeans on every kind of mission to
Madagascar.'5 Nearly every British envoy from Mauritius traveling to Madagascar was pro-
vided by the colonial government with enslaved interpreters who could translate between
Malagasy and French and/or English. Some of these slaves were even of "Mozambique"
or east African birth. East Africans picked up Malagasy speech varieties either on their land
journey through Madagascar to the Mascarenes or in the Mascarenes themselves, where
Malagasy served as a contact language.'6 We know of these interpreting bondmen in part
because of their tendency to flee their masters.
"Received Lamoora," wrote British ambassador Robert Lyall from Antananarivo on
October 5, 1828, "a Malgash slave, belonging to the Government of the Mauritius, who
ran away from Mr. Bennet at Tamatave, from Mr. Griffiths. Had him put in irons, and on
the 6th ordered him twenty lashes with a small whip."'7 In the business of slave keeping and
discipline, British missionaries were no exception. Mr. Bennet was a visiting LMS mission-
ary sent to inspect the work of his colleagues at Antananarivo. Like Jones, the Governor of
Mauritius had supplied him with a multilingual slave. David Griffiths had been responsible
for recapturing Mr. Bennet's truant bondman, Lamoora, at Tamatave, hauling him more
than 200 kilometers back to Imerina, and handing him over to the British ambassador,
Robert Lyall, for whipping. This vignette of slave linguistic service, flight, and recapture was
not something either Bennet or Griffiths reported to LMS directors in London, or Griffiths
to his friends and supporters in Wales. There were certain realities a missionary had to enter
into when he worked in the western Indian Ocean, it seemed, and these were best kept in
the hush from the Evangelical communities in Britain.'8
Let us return to David Jones and his slave Joseph. "It was thought just &amp;amp; neces-
sary," explained Jones referring to himself and his wife on their first journey together to

Madagascar, "as we could get no Malagash teacher, to take with us two slaves or servants
who could speak French and Malagash; and who would act as interpreters between us and
the Malgash-besides taking care of our luggage." With a slave, went the reasoning, one
might kill two irksome birds of travel-communication and the ponderousness of baggage-
with a single stone. "We petitioned his Ex. G. G. Hall," the acting governor of Mauritius,
Jones continued, "for two Govt. slaves, whom he gave us with the greatest pleasure and rice
for two months."19 Both Jones and his wife (who died soon after arrival in Madagascar) en-
joyed the services of these slaves. Thomas Bevan had also employed a slave named Joseph as
his interpreter, a man David Jones accused in 1818, shortly after Bevan's death, of poisoning
him (Jones).20
Government Blacks, in the servile employ of missionaries for both their translation
services and their sweat, were more precisely a legal category of persons variously known in
British colonies as apprentices, liberated Africans, or prize negroes.2' But legal niceties aside
missionaries found it difficult to name them other than as slaves, a term which apparently
captures the nature of their relationship to the men. Government Blacks had been captives
aboard vessels bound for the Mascarenes and surrounding territories, including the Cape
Colony. If intercepted by ships of the Royal Navy and condemned in courts of vice admi-
ralty at the Cape or in Mauritius as illegal slavers, these slave-trading vessels and their cargo
were forfeited to the crown. Such captives who arrived in colonial ports as slaves were then
typically indentured out on contracts of seven to fourteen years to private individuals or to
government, hence the term Government Blacks. At the termination of their indentures
they were to become legally free.22
Indentured translators such as Joseph continued to work for British missionaries in
Madagascar well after the clerics became fluent in Antananarivo's speech variety. What we
don't know is how long the translators continued to render linguistic services to the mission-
aries, or precisely how. When David Jones departed Madagascar in 1830 his erstwhile trans-
lator, Joseph, suddenly reappeared in Jones's communications with the British governor of
Mauritius. "In 1818 General Hall, then Acting Governor of the Mauritius, granted me a
Government slave, named Joseph, to assist me as an interpreter and to render me assistance
in the mission," Jones wrote to the secretary for the governor. He did not explain precisely
what he meant by "assistance in the mission."
I should like to have the instructions of His Excellency the Governor, whether I
am to take him back with me to the Mauritius or leave him here with his relations.
[Joseph had married a woman from Antananarivo and may have originated from
near the city.] He is now an old man about 50 or 60 years of age, and I do not think
he would be able to walk down to Tamatave. He has been, on the whole, a good
and useful servant; and if I return to the Mauritius before the end of this year, as I
intend, I should like him to remain, under oversight of my brother Missionaries, to
take charge of what I shall leave in the country. I shall be much obliged to you to
state the case to his Excellency: and please to let me know his instructions relative
thereto, which I shall attend to.23

PROMISCUOUS TRANSLATION: WORKING THE WORD AT ANTANANARIVO

Jones apparently heard nothing in reply to his query and departed Madagascar for Mauritius
without his "good and useful servant" Joseph to whom he now entrusted the care of his
personal belongings. On the cusp of leaving Mauritius for Britain a year later, Jones again
brought the matter of Joseph to the attention of the Governor.24 We do not know whether
Joseph ever returned to Mauritius.
In his earliest endeavors to acquire the language at Antananarivo, Jones utilized
as linguistic medium the French creole of Mauritius and Bourbon, which was spoken to
varying extents by King Radama, individuals involved in higher levels of government at
Antananarivo, the many highland Malagasy merchants trading to Madagascar's east coast,
and by the interpreter-slave named Joseph.21 "It was through a knowledge of it [French
creole] that I am become so familiar with Radama in interpreting and visiting for him and
through the assistance of which of I have learned the Madagascar tongue," Jones confided
in a letter nearly a year after his arrival at Antananarivo.26 Joseph, the translator with whom
he spoke French creole most often and who provided Jones with "assistance in the mission,"
was important to the missionary's early Malagasy language acquisition and evangelizing ef-
forts, though we don't know precisely how.
A Mauritian slave of Malagasy origin, Joseph would have been the most competent
of Jones's associates in both tongues-indeed this is why Jones had sought the services of a
Government Black from Mauritius to begin with. It is likely that the ever-shadowy Joseph's
French-Malagasy services are what Jones meant when he wrote that "through the assistance
of[it] I have learned the Madagascar tongue." One can imagine Jones and Joseph participat-
ing together in the school or discussing Jesus's death and resurrection with Radama's court-
iers, working through the French creole as Joseph spoke Malagasy with Jones's interlocutors
(enslaved interpreters from Mauritius were also utilized by the court at Antananarivo, the
most famous of whom was Cherri, given by British ambassador James Hastie to Radama).27
We must imagine how Jones and Joseph worked together, unfortunately, for we know noth-
ing more concrete than that Joseph was Jones's translator, that the range of his linguistic
competence included both Malagasy and French, and that he had offered Jones substantive
"assistance in the mission."
III
Within weeks of their respective arrivals in Antananarivo in 1820 and 1821, David Jones
and David Griffiths each received of King Radama a number of boys and girls aged six to
nine with whom to commence their schools. (Thomas Bevan, who had accompanied David
Jones to Madagascar's east coast in 1818, died in early 1819 and does not feature in the
history of schools and translation at Antananarivo). But schools are easier said than done
when students and teachers speak different tongues. Precisely what trans-linguistic literacy
instruction within the royal-LMS schools at Antananarivo actually looked like is masked by

the sometimes opaque epistolary prose in the LMS archive and the virtual absence of ac-
counts of the work of the word from students. The evidence we have to work with, in other
words, comes primarily from the very party which often claimed for itself the sole honor of
translation. Interactions among key players in literacy work and translation must often be
read in the syntax and between the lines of foreign pastors' correspondence.
The absurdity of Jones and Griffiths attempting to teach the "three Rs" to children in
the absence of adequate interlingual communication skills, or books, was imagined with a
degree of candor in a hagiographic tale for British school children composed decades later by
LMS Madagascar missionary Annie Sharman, who was apparently unaware of the linguistic
services that Joseph had provided.
I told you that Mr. Jones had quite a good-sized school; but fancy, if you can, a
school without any books! The Malagasy actually had no alphabet, and so nobody
knew how to read or write. There was no printing, and there was not a single
book in the Malagasy language. It must have been a very funny school-probably
no slates, no books, no pictures! And the teacher himself only knew a little of the
language of those pupils, and of course nobody knew much English or Welsh! I
think Mr. Jones must have been very clever indeed to manage a school under such
conditions.21
There actually were some slates, books, and pictures in Imerina's schools, but Jones
and Griffiths's "cleverness" at Antananarivo also rested on the assistance of enslaved inter-
preters and the young students in their schools. "Mr. Jones," Griffiths once reported, "said
that he knew from experience that a person could acquire this language by keeping a school,
conversing with the children, and the people, than to shut up in his house."129 "I said, that I
knew by experience," Jones confirmed himself of that philosophy, that "a person can acquire
that language [Malagasy] much easier and sooner by teaching a school and conversing with
the people of the different districts around the Capital, than by remaining all together at
the same place and among the same people every day."30 Because missionaries did not travel
much from Antananarivo before 1823, however, their primary interlocutors remained their
enslaved translators and their youthful students together with a limited segment of the urban
population-mainly those about the court-with whom they came into occasional contact.
Teaching was learning, in this pedagogy of acquisition-through-conversation.
While the Welshmen struggled to learn Malagasy, it is clear that Jones and Griffiths,
like Englishman John Jeffreys who arrived well after them in 1822, commenced instruction
in their schools in English. This important point requires elaboration, for learning English
was a prerequisite to translation efforts. Upon arrival in Antananarivo, Jones begin writing
his contacts in both Mauritius and Britain requesting English lessons for his school. "As the
English language will now be adopted to be taught to the people and not the French lan-
guage," he noted ten days after his arrival, "it will be necessary to have many Lancastrian les-
sons sent out for the use of the schools."'31 Impressed upon missionary candidates at Gosport,

PROMISCUOUS TRANSLATION: WORKING THE WORD AT ANTANANARIVO

the Lancastrian method of which Jones spoke was designed for inexpensive mass education
and required that more accomplished students, known as monitors, teach the newer and less
proficient ones under the supervision of a missionary evangelist.32 "I will thank you to send
me as many as you have to spare of the English lessons at Belleombre [a Mauritius estate
where Jones had previously worked with the children of enslaved Malagasy speakers]," Jones
begged of Charles Telfair, the island governor's personal secretary, through the advocacy of
whom he also requested Governor Farquhar to have Lancastrian lessons printed in Mauritius
and conveyed to Antananarivo.33 Some months later Jones wrote to the LMS directors for
"two or three sets" of English primers.34
On a brief visit to Mauritius in mid-1821, Jones appealed directly to Governor
Farquhar, requesting materials for his "Royal College" and also for the planned "National
School" to be superintended by David Griffiths and which would enroll non-royal youth.
"Subjoined I take the liberty of enclosing a list and estimate of the things we shall require for
the use of the Royal School established agreeably to Your Excellency's desire at the Court of
Ova [Imerina] for the education of the Princes of Radama's family and also for the establish-
ment of a national school in the Lancastrian system," Jones wrote to Governor Farquhar
while in Port Louis.
Your Excellency has been pleased to furnish a parcel of lessons which you had the
goodness to bring from England for that purpose: these lessons are peculiarly adapt-
ed for the use of the Madagascar school; and for spreading the knowledge of the
English language it will be a great favour done to the Madagascar national school,
were Your Excellency to direct that one hundred copies of these lessons should be
struck off at the printing offices at Port Louis to be forwarded to Radama.3"
Farquhar soon acceded to Jones's request. Jones probably carried these English lessons with
him when he returned to Antananarivo in September 1821.36 Britain was extending its west-
ern Indian Ocean empire through the labor of Welshmen and the medium of English and
its letters.
IV
In May 1821 Jones reported on the progress of his students. "My time has.., been em-
ployed in teaching about 16 children delivered under my care by Radama to receive an
English education," he wrote. Four of the students "begin to read portions of the sacred
scriptures in English with some fluency, and they knew not one of the alphabets when I be-
gan to teach them in last November.37 At a more elementary level, the newest students were
still learning to spell and to read. When he arrived in Antananarivo at the end of May 1821,
David Griffiths superintended Jones's students from the royal family for two months during
Jones's travel to Mauritius before commencing his National School later in the year (at this
point, Griffiths spoke English and French as well as Welsh, but not Malagasy).38 Throughout

1821 and 1822 English instruction dominated in both Welshmen's schools. "I am daily em-
ployed in studying the language of this country and in teaching the children of the King's
family in the Royal College who learn to read and write English," reported Jones in March
1822.'9 When that same year he returned from a voyage to London, Ratefy (Radama's sis-
ter's husband and father of two of Jones's students) wrote to the LMS directors how he was
"particularly [gratified] to see my little boy and girl reading and writing english under the
care of Mr. Jones."'40 A few months later Mauritius Governor Farquhar's envoy James Hastie
and newly arrived English missionary John Jeffreys examined Jones and Griffiths's students.
They reported that the "first class of boys being called on to exhibit their lessons held forth
their books with that pleasing openness of countenance which pure minds afford."'4' The
books were printed English sacred volumes and English grammars.
When the Englishman John Jeffreys joined Jones and Griffiths in Imerina in mid-
1822, he and his wife, Keturah, also commenced teaching English to the twelve students
sent to them by Radama.42 Neither Jones nor Griffiths would lend any of their language ma-
terials to the Jeffreys, who were forced to commence their language work from scratch and
remained well behind their Welsh colleagues throughout 1822 and 1823 in acquisition of
the vernacular.43 Ethnic-based suspicion may have animated the strained relationship among
Welsh and English missionaries in Imerina, but there is little concrete evidence for this;
disagreements were always about substantive issues and certainly the Welshmen were not in
agreement among themselves. "[W]hile I am teaching the children the English I am myself
acquiring the malagash [sic]," John wrote shortly after he commenced his school in June
1822, reporting the same language-acquisition procedure the two Welshmen had adopted
before him.44 A year after his arrival in Antananarivo, however, Jeffreys reported that "I have
laboured at the language all this time &amp;amp; am now able to converse a little with the natives."45
For all LMS missionaries, acquisition of Malagasy was a lengthy and laborious process, but
much facilitated by their interactions with urban youth and enslaved translators.
During the first three years of their existence, then, the missionary schools in
Antananarivo were principally Anglophone in curriculum. The same held true for the LMS's
public gatherings, which were usually comprised of missionaries, their students (whose at-
tendance was compulsory), other Europeans in Antananarivo, and sometimes the king and
sundry members of the royal court. The slave Joseph was no doubt also in audience. During
such gatherings, missionaries addressed their public comments in both English and French.
Occasionally a stray adult would tarry at the windows to tickle his or her ears with the sound
of foreign tongues emanating from within. When the Griffiths lost their two-and-a-half-
year-old son to an affliction of the lungs, "A funeral sermon was delivered at Mr. Griffiths's
house in the morning both in English and French," noted the missionaries, "and also an ad-
dress at the grave in both languages. All the English and the French at Tananarivou and also
the children of the schools attended the funeral."'46 Jones baptized the Griffiths's daughter,
Sarah Elizabeth, on March 20, 1823 in a similar bilingual English-French ceremony that

was attended by "His Majesty Radama, His royal consort, three of his royal sisters, [and]
Prince Rataffe.''47 Until mid-1824, weekly Sunday worship and other religious rites were
conducted in French and English-but never in Malagasy.41
Meanwhile students' keen appetite for English learning was testified unanimously in
clerical letters and journals. (Little is said about how much of the French spoken at public
gatherings or in the schools the students actually understood). "They possess wonderful
talents," wrote David Jones to his sister, "and in their diligence and avidity to learn, I believe
that no children can surpass them."'49 "We soon found that the children possessed no mean
capacities," wrote Keturah of her and John's students. "Our instructions were received with
gratitude and earnestness.... The native children are as generally capable of receiving in-
struction as any in our own country; and, from all the observations I have made, much more
attentive and concerned to attain it. It is very seldom that they discover any of that ennui,
and want of interest in their lessons, which is so common in our English schools; their ap-
plication is unwearied, till they attain their tasks, and that with great correctness."50
The apparent enthusiasm of Antananarivo's youth for English letters soon led to an
acute shortage of reading materials. The more advanced books missionaries had brought
with them were mostly intended for their own study. "I have now under my care in the Royal
Academy forty four scholars who continue [with] the same diligence and avidity to learn as
they have done always," reported Jones of his students at the king's court some eighteen
months after arriving in Imerina. "Some of the most advanced of them read in the [English]
New Testament, write on paper and work the common rules of arithmetic; and I shall want
very soon some Bibles and more Testaments, English Grammars, pronouncing dictionaries,
books on arithmetic &amp;amp;c. and even before they can be sent out from England."51 For some
of these wants in English-language instructional materials, many of them sacred, the clerics
solicited colleagues and supporters close at hand in the British colony of Mauritius. But few
books actually arrived from Mauritius, where they were exceedingly dear.
The Welshmen next turned to their countrymen. In early January 1822 David Griffiths
wrote to churches in Wales to explain his and David Jones's ideas about how to solve the
deficiency of English books.
Anxious to do all we can for the spiritual &amp;amp; temporal welfare of these interesting
peoples &amp;amp; especially the rising generation, we had purposed to establish a Missionary
and school library at Tananarivo, the Capital of Madagascar and agreed to make it
known as extensively as possible to all the well wishers of the Madagascar Mission....
As a word to the wise is sufficient, We flatter ourselves that our Cambrian Brethren
will not be backward, but will come forward like men, and deem it no small honour
to form the first library at one of the most promising stations.52
Conveying English books to an island in the Indian Ocean, the argument went, would
augment the masculine honor of Cambrians. The currency of honor attached to literacy
and translation in LMS discourse is a measure of the seriousness with which matters of the
word were taken. Griffiths also chastised the LMS directors in London for what he felt was

neglect in dispatching materials for use in the schools of Antananarivo. "I trust that you
will forward to us by the first opportunity various articles for the use of schools, Bibles and
testaments, two hundreds at least of each, spelling books &amp;amp; English grammars, 100 of each.
Slates and pencils, and different sorts of copy plates &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c. We are at present labouring
under many difficulties for the want of these things, and as we cannot procure these things in
Madagascar you must be perfectly aware that we cannot do without them. 0 have pity upon
us."553 When in December 1822 the LMS mission at Antananarivo took delivery of a set of
French hymn books from London, Jones and Griffiths could find little use for them.54
Jones and Griffiths finally received notification in late 1823 that the LMS had dis-
patched English Bibles and Testaments printed by the British and Foreign Bible Society,
but these were not yet to hand. "It afforded us a great pleasure to understand that the
Directors had paid such a prompt attention to our request concerning a supply of books
for the schools," explained Jones gratefully of the news. "We have been labouring under
many disadvantages to communicate instructions to our scholars for want of them, having
but one book to give between a dozen of children."55 Soon after he and Keturah arrived in
Antananarivo, John Jeffreys also wrote to the LMS directors to send out "A great quan[tit]
y of writing paper and ink powder, common paper [for the] use of the schools also superior
for that of the mission. These above all things do not forget: a sufficient number of slates and
slate pen sets."'56
Missionaries' repeated calls for slates, pencils, ink, and both "common" and "superior"
paper in addition to English books suggests that students in Antananarivo were beginning to
write as well as to read by mid-1822. While briefly teaching some children on the east coast
of Madagascar in 1818, Jones had made his students write with their fingers in the sand of
the beach. Strands being in short supply at the altitude of Antananarivo, however, the mis-
sionaries turned to slates, "copy plates," and other inventions. The chronic deficiency of
slates was resolved with an ingenious, if grimy, local solution explained by LMS "mechanic"
James Cameron.
The work of education commenced in earnest; but there was no printing then,
and not many slates; all lessons were written by hand, and as a substitute for slates,
smooth boards were rubbed over with a soft grease and dusted with ashes. On this
the letters and figures were formed with a wooden stile, like a common pencil;
corrections were made or sums renewed simply by rubbing with a rag or with the
finger, and commencing again as contentedly as if no cleanlier or better mode had
ever been found out.57
It is not inconceivable that Jones and Griffiths had actually learned to spell in this fashion in
the Cardiganshire countryside.
As the first students in the schools learned to form words and write sentences and para-
graphs in English using adapted European technologies of literacy, they began to move from
slates to the more precious medium of paper. Not manufactured in Imerina, where wood
was valuable and trees scarce, writing paper in the schools was largely controlled by the mis-

sionaries, who mostly received it from abroad.58 Students were therefore probably limited in
their writing to projects sanctioned and supervised by the missionaries, unless their king and
families independently acquired paper for them (this might have been the case for some of
Jones's students in the Royal College). "It would be very desirable to have a few reams of
paper for the schools sent out for us," David Jones requested of one of the LMS directors,
"also paper for private and official letters, and some blank books for Registers, Journals,
accounts &amp;amp;c.: as all sort of paper and books are excessively dear at the Mauritius."'59 Much
paper arrived from both London and the governor's office at Mauritius, making "the article
of stationary" one the earliest forms of British foreign aid to Madagascar. Missionaries kept
their paper under lock and key, but that did not prevent their stocks from appearing time to
time for sale in Antananarivo's market places, suggesting a growing demand for material on
which to write.60 Reporting on the progress of his students in early 1822, Jones stated that
"There are eight of them reading in the New Testament, writing a small hand and ciphering,
two of whom are the children of Prince Rataffe [Radama's brother-in-law]. There are four
more, who read select passages of the sacred Scriptures, &amp;amp; have begun to write on paper. All
the others are following them in spelling with every attention and diligence.61
English replaced French, then, with some rapidity in LMS efforts at Antananarivo. The
LMS missionaries first taught the English alphabet to their students, with spelling and read-
ing in English preceding experiments in writing on slates and paper, which were then fol-
lowed by introduction to arithmetic. "I have a number of children in it [the school]," Jones
wrote in mid- 1822, "who read &amp;amp; write, some of whom are gone through the common rules
of arithmetic. There are some of them who appear to possess great abilities to learn and
will in time, I hope, prove a blessing to their country."62 If competence in reading, writing,
and arithmetic was a measure of children's potential "blessing to their country," Jones's
students clearly fulfilled his expectations in English language studies. The three Rs were
each first taught at Antananarivo in English, commencing with reading, then writing, and
finally numbers. Because translation at Antananarivo proceeded from English to Malagasy,
students' studies of English and their ability to compose on slate and paper were key to their
participation in the labor of transforming texts from English into their own speech variety.
As the students in Antananarivo progressed in reading and writing English, they be-
gan to apply the English-Latin alphabet to the spelling of words in their own language.
Transported across tongues, the phonetic principles of the English alphabet allowed them
to compile Malagasy glosses for English words. Study of the three Rs in English, then,
was directly linked to orthography and literate competence in Malagasy. By mid-1822, the
most advanced of Jones's students in Antananarivo "translated some words into their own
language," as did also the second class.63 The missionaries and the children found "continu-
ally an immense field for research in studying the [Malagasy] language" during 1822 and
1823, confirmed Jones. Everyone worked persistently "in correcting and making additions
to our [Malagasy] vocabularies &amp;amp;c."'64 Discussing the process of language acquisition in

1823, David Griffiths also confided in his journal that "the language can be more effectu-
ally acquired by conversing with the children and having them to write phrases and words
in their own language, on the slates &amp;amp;c.''61 What is especially enlightening about this set
of exposes is that while missionaries were struggling to acquire a verbal knowledge of the
language of Antananarivo in 1822 and 1823, students were already writing it. At the end
of 1822, Jones noted, "There are many children now in the schools who can read and write
both English and Malagash.''66 Griffiths confirmed this development in the schools when
he wrote in early 1823, and with approval, about "The progress that our pupils have made
and the desire which they daily manifest to spell and write words in their own language, and
the pride that they take in addressing each other in their native tongue."'67 The pride derived
from vernacular literacy, the ever nationalistic Griffiths felt, was something shared by both
Cambrians and their highland Malagasy schoolchildren. He may well have been correct
about how a Latin writing system for the dialect of Antananarivo fostered a new sense of
pleasure and identity among some of its youthful residents. Benedict Anderson would make
a similar sort of claim more a century and a half later.68
Missionaries had compiled Malagasy wordlists in previous years, but as the students
progressed they soon adopted a more systematic and labor-intensive approach: they pro-
vided English words alphabetically culled from dictionaries to teams of the most capable of
their students, requesting the students to supply them in return with vernacular glosses for
the English terms. Typically, students worked these lexical translations on their slates, which
were easily transportable to hearth and home for consultation. The results were later copied
by missionaries into their paper Malagasy "vocabularies," which eventually formed the basis
of two dictionaries published at the LMS press in Antananarivo in 1835 at the behest of
Radama's successor and senior wife, Queen Ranavalona.69
LMS personnel were also under instructions from London to create Malagasy lan-
guage catechisms and scriptural translations as soon as possible. By means of catechisms,
Bogue had lectured his students at the Gosport seminary, "A great number of falsehoods
and superstitions will be banished from [heathen] minds."7° Despite linguistic challenges,
both Jones and Griffiths claimed to have composed catechisms in the King's language as
early as January 1822.7' Jones composed his during 1821, he said, "after the method of
Watts," while Griffiths drew his up, independently he implied, yet "somewhat on the same
plan with that of Mr. Jones."172 At this time Griffiths had been in Madagascar for a total of
ten months and tending his school for only five, while Jones had been residing and teach-
ing inside the court for only nine months .7 By their own evaluation their language skills at
this point were especially poor, and their work in the schools consuming. Missionaries were
actively instructing students in English at this time. It wasn't until two and a half years later
(1824) that the foreign evangelists began to preach and speak publicly in Malagasy, and to
conduct their classrooms in that language.

PROMISCUOUS TRANSLATION: WORKING THE WORD AT ANTANANARIVO

"In our schools there are some of our first children beginning to translate catechisms
from the English into their own tongue," noted Jones rather openly by early 1823, explain-
ing the central role of the children in the work "and who, in a short time, will afford us
a great assistance in the translation of the scriptures &amp;amp;c. Others are now forming school
lessons in their own tongue, and begin to teach and catechize their juniors on Sundays with-
out our assistance."'74 The LMS missionaries' first twelve students, were key not only to a
variety of translation projects but also to verbal evangelism, a pattern typical in British over-
seas missions and part of the evangelizing strategy taught at Gosport.7s Students who were
translating catechisms from English to Malagasy in early 1823 were on the cusp of offering
"a great assistance in the translation of the scriptures," a project the missionaries said took
place during the two years between 1824 and 1826. "A version of the scriptures is rendered
into the Malagash language and we are going on as fast as possible with revising our transla-
tions," Griffiths reported to the LMS directors in April 1826.76 Given that the missionaries
only trusted their Malagasy skills sufficiently to speak and preach publicly in that language in
mid-1824, when they first reported embarking on biblical translation, they were permitting
themselves--only the pair of them-a mere two years to convert the entire scriptures into
Malagasy.
Jones and Griffiths always taught separately and labored apart from each other on their
translation projects with their first twelve students. These linguistic helpers were distributed
evenly between the two missionaries. In other words, the Welshmen worked with their most
accomplished students in linguistic teams. Youth were organized and directed by the mis-
sionaries with the support of King Radama. This is also the way in which Jeffreys fimctioned
once he arrived in mid-1822, the difference being that his team was much less advanced
than those of his Welsh colleagues. Jeffreys departed Imerina in 1825 without contributing
to biblical translation. In claiming credit for biblical and other translations, the two Welsh
missionaries were in fact discussing the work performed by teams under their direction.
Among David Jones's students, all of whom were of royal extraction, the most helpful in
these early translation projects were David Ramaka, John Rakoto (Rakotobe), David Raharo
(Raharolahy), Ramaholy (aka Rainifiringa), Rasatranabo, and Ratsisatraina, many of whom
went on to important careers in the kingdom administration when the missionaries departed.
We learn their names from documents produced after 1830, not from contemporary letters.
Griffiths's team consisted of both royals and commoners and included John Rainisoa (aka
Ratsimandisa), Ratsimihara, Andriantsoa, Rabohara, Andriamaka, and Ratsitohaina.
Jones and Griffiths labored with their teams of students-and Jones may have also
consulted his slave Joseph-at basic translation projects during the day, and copied the re-
suilts of mutual effort into their manuscripts in the evening. Jeffreys's journal in mid-April
1823 provides a telling example.

18 Employed in the school in the evening copying words out of the English
Dictionary.
19 School in the morning, in the afternoon engaged in the language.77
Jones and Griffiths were frank about their procedure. Explaining the structure of their work-
ing days to the LMS directors, the Welshmen noted that they each started teaching school
at sunrise and instructed the students to about 8:30 in the morning. "After this" they said,
the girls are taught in needle work, and we and our boys are employed in translating
and the study of the Malagash language until noon, when the school is commenced
again in the afternoon and dismissed about 4 or 5 and then we dine and take a little
recreation if we have time. In the evenings until 10 or 11 o clock we write on paper,
translations and Malagash sentences and expressions written [by the students] on
slates during the day.78
The translation of the Bible from English into Malagasy and the role of youth in each
stage of the process is explicitly confirmed by a fourth LMS minister, J. J. Freeman, who
arrived in Antananarivo in September 1827. Freeman's stay in Madagascar was short. He
departed Antananarivo after an "unhappy difference" that erupted among the LMS mis-
sionaries over the wisdom of employing school youth in biblical translation and revision.
Freeman outspokenly disapproved of such participation, for in his demanding evaluation the
students' skills in both English and Malagasy were not up to the task. According to him, nei-
ther were those of the Welshmen. "I became too dissatisfied with the mode of proceeding in
the Revision to take any longer a part in it," Freeman explained of the scriptural translations.
They are Crude. They were commenced before any adequate acquaintance with
the language was obtained. They were got up too hastily. They were, to a great
extent, made by the Malagasy youths who had been taught something of English
by Messrs. J. &amp;amp; G. these cursorily looked over, and copied into a Book, and this
was considered a Translation. Frequently (and I name this as an illustration) Mr.
G[riffiths]. had 4 or 5 of their youths round his table of an evening, &amp;amp; all translat-
ing different parts of the scriptures at the same time; one say the Psalms, another a
prophet, another a Gospel, and another an Epistle, Mr. G. sat by correcting these,
so far as he knew the Malagasy, then very imperfectly &amp;amp; turning from one to an-
other. Could either one of them, mere School exercises onto slate, be deemed even
an approximation to excellence, or even fidelity?79
In these round-table practices of translation lay an inversion of the division of labor
when the subject of study was English. When learning English, the children copied and
pondered texts proffered to them in print or produced in manuscript by the missionaries.
But in vernacular work it was the children who composed, translating from English, and
the Welshmen who copied vernacular compositions from youths' slates and parsed them to
determine their meanings and structures. Tellingly, the missionaries do not report having
employed students in the tedium of copying during this period. In part, it may be they felt
paper and ink too precious to entrust to the children. A more likely explanation was the
value of keeping boys to the productive intellectual work of translation on slates, where cor-

PROMISCUOUS TRANSLATION: WORKING THE WORD AT ANTANANARIVO

rections and changes could easily be registered. To recopy their manuscripts, then, Jones and
Griffiths turned to their British colleagues, the "missionary artisans" who had been sent to
Antananarivo by the LMS at the request of Radama and at great expense to the home office,
but who had found themselves idle for want of materials and markets.80 Mr. Canham, the
weaver, they explained, "has rendered us a great assistance these last months in copying from
our manuscripts spelling and reading lessons for the schools. He has been also writing out
some parts of our vocabularies according to the present orthography settled by the King.
We could employ him many months more as a writer if the supply of leather had not arrived
from the Mauritius and want of shoes did not call him away."81
Students not only participated in translation projects, they assisted in revision of the
working manuscripts. The Welshmen's teams turned to revisions once a first translation of the
entire scriptures had been completed in 1826. Revisions proceeded very slowly between 1826
and 1830 for the New Testament, and between 1830 and 1835 for the Old. The role of mis-
sionaries in the revision was far greater than it had been in the original production of transla-
tions from English to Malagasy. An important task in the revision was "comparison" of the
Malagasy translation with Hebrew and Greek scripture originals, something only the mission-
aries had the linguistic skill to effect. A proposal to teach the students Greek and Hebrew had
been struck down by both the queen and LMS directors. "The New Testament is now printed
in the Malagasy and a number of them are distributed among the natives," newly arrived Welsh
missionary David Johns reported of the process in 1830, "We shall begin next week to revise
the Old Testament, which will be an employment to us for years. We must compare it all with
the Hebrew," he noted, because the translation had been produced from the English Revised
Version of 1611 but was required to conform to the original languages.82
As their knowledge of Malagasy increased, LMS personnel intervened to a much
greater extent in emending and amending the translated text and conforming it to classical
languages. The students' role in revision, as best we can tell from the evidence, went primar-
ily to copy editing and issues of usage. The primary role of translation labor had shifted from
local youth to foreign adults. The minutes of the LMS missionaries' business meetings testify
to students' work on the revisions, however, as do their letters. The following entry appears
in May 1829 during the final preparation of the New Testament for printing: "To 6 youths
for the revision, 3 attending on Monday and Tuesday, 3 on Thursday &amp;amp; Friday, 3/4 Dollr.
for 100 verses, 1/8th of a dollar for correcting a sheet from the press, 1/4th of a dollar to
2 youths for copying 100 verses."83 David Griffiths kept corrected proof sheets of Psalms
chapters 75 to 88 with six names of Malagasy revisers on them: Ratsimihara, [Ra]Tsimilay,
Rainisoa, Raharo, Raharolahy and [Ra]Tsisatraina.14

Because foreign missionaries did not become conversant in the speech variety ofAntananarivo
until at least 1824 and preferred to continue working with native Malagasy speakers there-
after, translation at Antananarivo relied on a variety of skills brought to the task by many
individuals. Missionaries were central to the process of planning, organizing, and financing
translation projects, but they relied in the first instance on the linguistic services of slaves
who had been born in Madagascar and who had acquired competence in the French creole
while in captivity at Mauritius. Some of these interpreter-slaves on whom missionaries de-
pended between 1818 and the early 1820s remained with the missionaries throughout the
translation process. We do not know the extent and precise nature of their involvement in
vernacular literacy projects, from vocabularies, to catechisms, to the Christian scriptures. But
we do know that some of the bondsmen, like Joseph, continued to serve the missionaries
until their departure from Madagascar.
The scriptures at Antananarivo were converted directly out of the language of King
James into that of King Radama with minimal reference, in the first instance, to classical
languages. Most translation projects between 1820 and the departure of the missionaries in
1836 relied on the services of children in the royal-LMS schools rather than adult interpret-
er-slaves. These children were taught first in English and came later to write their mother
tongue employing the technologies of English-language literacy. They were soon set to col-
lect vernacular word lists, generate vernacular glosses, and translate passages from the Bible
between English and their mother tongue. Most early English-to-Malagasy translations were
effected on slate and copied by foreign missionaries into their paper manuscripts. English-
Malagasy translations scratched out by children were later transformed by missionaries with
the assistance of schoolchildren through a process of "revision" and "comparison" with
classical texts such as the Septuagint and Griesbach's Greek New Testament to conform in a
number of ways to Mediterranean-language originals.
The published end-product of translation looked as if it might have come right out
of the classical scriptural languages, but was in fact the outcome of a multi-stagedprocess of
translation, copying, comparison, and revision involving British missionaries and a number
of Malagasy assistants from varying backgrounds. If missionaries claimed the honor of bibli-
cal translation for themselves, they worked in dependence on and collaboration with their
interpreter-slaves and school students. The history of translation in Antananarivo, then, is
one of labor entanglement and'intellectual promiscuity, not the outcome of individual work
by a handful of especially intelligent British missionaries.
Conclusions similar to those drawn here were reached six decades ago by Norwegian
linguist and missionary Otto Christian Dahi. Dahi's findings, published in Norwegian and
restricted to a relatively small reading audience, were disputed by fellow Norwegian mis-
sionary Ludvig Munthe, who published his much more widely circulated work in French

PROMISCUOUS TRANSLATION: WORKING THE WORD AT ANTANANARIVO

and claimed on the basis of textual analysis of the printed version of the Malagasy Bible that
missionaries conducted the work of translation by themselves and directly from Hebrew and
Greek into the island's vernacular. For the many reasons explored and documented in this
article, Dahl was correct, not Munthe. Munthe worked only with the finalproduct of trans-
lation-the published Bible of 1835. He did not examine the process of translation or credit
the words of missionaries as contained in their letters, notes, and journals.85
In the matter of translation at Antananarivo, doubt about the hagiographic myth of
missionaries' linguistic and literary independence is confirmed through a close reading of
the archive. For histories of translation and youth more broadly, the story of the work of the
word at Antananarivo is not simply one of the elision of co-authorship. More productively-
and far more interestingly-it is one of how co-authorship opens up new questions in the
intellectual history of world Christianity and the significance of youth and generation in early
translation efforts.

PORTRAITS OF AKAN AND CAMEROONIAN GRASSFIELD KINGS AND CHIEFS

Portraits of Akan and Cameroonian
Grassfield Kings and Chiefs in
the Basel Mission Archive
PAUL JENKINS, FORMER ARCHIVIST, BASEL MISSION;
LECTURER IN AFRICAN HISTORY, UNIVERSITY OF BASEL
Introduction
n 1990 and 1994, David Henige published two early interpretative essays about pho-
tographs in the Basel Mission archive.1 His quick acceptance of these papers had a use-
ful impact for us in Basel. At that time work with photographs as sources for African
history was still very new, and few people realized that mission archives would have
much to contribute. In Basel we were looking for finance for a first effort to open to public
access a body of photographs whose size, quality, and chronological depth were surpris-
ing us. Christraud Geary had already given the collection prominence by including Basel
Mission materials in her 1988 Washington, D.C. exhibition on German colonial photogra-
phy at the court of King Njoya.2 With the two essays published by David Henige, we had
real gravitas when we approached potential sources of support. Now, two decades later, as a
direct result of the grants which were secured for work with the Basel Mission picture archive
from that time, almost 30,000 catalogued images from this collection are accessible online.
They are part of the 50,000 images from seven different European and American mission ar-
chives on offer in the International Mission Photography Archive (IMPA), one of the digital
archive collections run by the University of Southern California. Of these, roughly half are
photographs taken in Africa.3
With these developments in mind, this essay applies the study of photographs to a his-
torical analysis which is not primarily about the history of photography, but about a theme
in cultural and social history in two regions of West Africa. The focus is on the way portraits

of West African chiefs and kings in the photography of the Basel Mission archive may lead us
to consider neglected but important aspects of relations between chieftaincy and evangelical
Christian institutions in Ghana and Cameroon up to the time of the Second World War. This
theme can seem to be coin which has been worn smooth by many hands. We know from
first principles that there must have been intensive interaction between chiefs and kings in
Black Africa from the arrival of the first African or European missionaries in a region where
they held sway-with the missions' ambitious plans for grass-roots change it could not be
otherwise. And indeed there are detailed modern studies of such interactions from other
parts of Africa: Yoruba, Buganda and Tswana, to take three notable examples.4
But this is a field in which historical writing has a particular spice when it looks at a
local or regional context where kings and chiefs rooted in specific traditions are still a seri-
ous factor in local and regional fife, and the question of their future, in a rapidly globalis-
ing world, is acute. Hence this attempt to write about two specific regions of Africa: that
dominated by Akan patterns of kingship in the Eastern Region of Ghana and in Ashanti,
and in the Anglophone part of the Cameroon Grassfields. Both are classical kingdom ter-
ritories in African history and African anthropology.' The essay links two regional traditions
not because they were related to each other through the longue duree of African history, but
because the Basel Mission, a strongly centralized, mainstream Protestant mission, worked in
both areas. Its missionary men, having mostly enjoyed little beyond elementary schooling
and craft training at the time they joined the organization, had then undergone five years
intensive training in the Basel Mission College, which has been called a period of socializa-
tion in the Mission's particular institutional culture.6 They were, in the intention of the Basel
Mission leadership, to be a homogenous group, united in their view of Africa, and in the
measures they planned to adopt in their work. Their thoughts about photography are likely
therefore to have resembled one another, when they set out for Ghana and Cameroon-and
so did their approach to chieftaincy.
Longstanding contacts between missionary movements in Europe and regions of the
non-western world have their own dynamics. It was suggested, when I retired in 2003, that
I might work to encourage South Indian interest in the Basel Mission archive-and that
not simply among Christian scholars. In my struggles with trying to understand the other
environments and other parameters of Basel Mission history in South India I came to realize,
with surprise, that in the Basel Mission photo collection the proportion of images of rajahs
and maharajahs in South India to those of kings and chiefs in West Africa was as little as
1:20, although the Basel Mission, at least in terms of missionary numbers, grew larger faster
in South India than in West Africa.7 Why there are so few images in these categories from
India and what that absence implies in the setting of broad Basel Mission history in India
will have to be the theme of another essay. But this discrepancy sent me back to look again
at the photographs from West Africa. What sort of clues do they offer as to the significance
of kings and chiefs for missionaries and their African successors, and vice versa?

PORTRAITS OF AKAN AND CAMEROONIAN GRASSFIELD KINGS AND CHIEFS

At the level of the Basel Mission as institution there are signs of a fundamental paradox
in its assessment of chieftaincy. On the one side it recognized chiefs and kings as "powers
that be that are ordained by God" who therefore have a divinely-sanctioned claim on obedi-
ence.8 But at the same time the Mission called for a root-and-branch excision of elements
of traditional religion from traditional systems of rule, elements like animal sacrifice and
libation which seem still today, for the populations involved, to be essential to the conduct
of Akan and Cameroon Grassfield Kingdoms. In Ghana the mission's policy was to gather
its converts into Christian villages, the so-called Salems, and to prohibit participation in
traditional celebrations with a religious element.9 In the University of Ghana in the 1960s
it was axiomatic that the Salems were a colonialistic attempt to alienate people from their
traditional culture and replace that culture with a pietistic western one. The decisive articula-
tion of this view was probably a j'accuse addressed by the King of Akyem Abuakwa in 1941
to the Presbyterian Church Synod when it met in his capital, calling for a new formulation
of the relations between Christian subjects and traditional rulers.10 In Cameroon the Basel
Mission may have laid less emphasis on separated living, but the potential dichotomy arising
from the prohibition of Christian presence at heathen rites will have been real enough.
It seems to me to be axiomatic that, where they still exist, chiefs and kings are to be val-
ued as representing a force for social cohesion, as being people at the summit of the means of
arbitration and reconciliation in a familiar indigenous mode, using the familiar language and
procedures and indeed strategies of local social patterns. But although chiefs and kings in
Africa have these eminently moral functions, and although many of them in the regions we
are discussing are, nowadays, "serious Christians," they are automatically put under church
discipline on their election, on the grounds that their rule involves their presence at animal
sacrifices and other non-Christian rites.1 And this is no matter which can be handled dis-
cretely. My last experience of the public impact of this policy took place in Akropong in 1999.
The "discipline" involves exclusion from participating in Holy Communion. At a Harvest
Festival service after encouraging his people to contribute generously to the church's main
annual fund-raising event, the king withdrew in his palanquin before Communion was cel-
ebrated, and as the Communion service got under way you could hear the sound of his
drums growing weaker in the distance. Everyone knew the reason for his absence.
A Google search on the theme of the interrelations between chieftainy and Christianity
in Ghana confirms this as a subject still engaging wide interest and much passion. But there
is a strange anomaly in the academic literature which should be relevant to this theme. Both
on the side of studies of tradition and of Christianity specific discussions of this point are
rare. It is as if the mental structures of the old Salem debate have evolved into two quite sep-
arate modern discourses in which still the twain never meet. This can not only be checked by
looking for chapter-headings but also by searching the topics offered by rear indexes of stud-
ies which should be relevant to this theme. Explicit indications of relations to "Christianity,"
"church" or "mission" are rarely or never found in studies of the traditional state. A striking

PAUL JENKINS

example of this anomaly is the major collection of high-level essays Chieftaincy in Ghana
published in 2006, of whose 700 pages less than 30 are explicitly devoted to relations be-
tween chieftaincy and Christianity, and a dozen of those are devoted to one of the two mar-
ginal cases in South-Eastern Ghana in which a "chief" complicates matters who is in fact the
elected chairman of the local Presbytery.'2 And on the "Christian" side even a trenchant and
visionary commentator like Kwame Bediako, who built up the Akrofi-Christaller Research
Institute in no less a city than Akropong, offers no specific paragraphs or rear-index refer-
ences to issues in relations between church and traditional state in his main interpretation of
African Church History.'3 Perhaps that is not too surprising given that the classic modern
studies of Asante statecraft also avoid the topic; Asante's pre-colonial policy about missions
was to keep them excluded from Asante territory. But this has helped to steer historians'
eyes away from the question of what other policies about religion in general and missions in
particular were possible and practiced in indigenous states around Asante's margins. And it
seems to have inhibited many analysts from considering the possible cross-over elements in
the cultural interrelationships of two classes of institution which nowadays attract the most
public support and interest over the whole of rural and small-town Southern Ghana.14
It took the eye of an anthropologist, unexpectedly present in Akropong, a town which
is both the capital of an Akan kingdom and the site of the first inland Basel Mission station
in Ghana, to notice, in spite of the dichotomy public discourse asserted so loudly between
Christianity and tradition, that in the 1970s there were many levels of lively interaction in
Akropong between the traditional state and traditional family patterns on the one side, and
the long-established Presybterian congregation on the other.'5 John Middleton's landmark
essay on this can be taken to indicate that the anything-but-superficial discussions about
the acceptable boundaries of Christian behaviour which he found being carried on by lay
church elders in Akropong in the mid-1970s had deep chronological roots. Indeed in what
can fairly be called a visionary periodisation of church-state relations in Akwapim he ar-
gued-working on the basis of his anthropologist's instincts, and without having a strong
basis other than excellent oral sources among the town's church elders-that the serious
work of mutual accommodation between church and state in Akwapim began already in the
nineteenth century. These observations do not invalidate the fact that there is a last remnant
of church intransigence in its attitude to chiefs and kings more than a century later.
The background literature on this theme in the Cameroon Grassfields is much less
extensive than that relevant to this theme in Southern Ghana. Nevetheless Edward Lekunze
was awarded a Ph.D. at the Lutheran School of Theology in Chicago in 1987 with a disser-
tation titled Chieftaincy and Christianity in Cameroon 1886-1926, concentrating especially
on the activity of the Basel Mission.'6 He makes it clear which parts of his script refer to
"Chieftaincy [as] relevant to a centralised and hierarchical structure." And two of his four
case studies examine the kingdoms of Bali Nyonga and Bamum, which are important to the
argument of the present essay too. He begins with an affirmative answer to the all-important

question, "Did the chief invite the missionaries?"-though one is justified in feeling that
he was not able to go as far as necessary and possible in defining these two kings' policies
vis-a-vis the mission. He does, however, rightly point out that an invitation from a chief
was an invitation to approach a whole community structured as the elders of the commu-
nity understood it, and comes to the conclusion that the missionaries at that stage had a
fatal tendency to judge that "important Cameroonian social structures and institutions, as
chieftaincy.., were steeped in a 'heathen' culture [and] were outrightly anti-Christian, and
had to be subverted" (my emphasis).'7 A recent and as yet unpublished SOAS dissertation
by Guy Thomas takes this history on into the inter-war period, in a chapter which, report-
ing on relations with Grassfields chiefs, is, at least at first sight, dominated by conflicts over
control over individuals and families between chiefs exercising their traditional authority,
and missionaries and indigenous church leaders "bringing up" new Christians to live in the
parameters appropriate to Christians.8
A search for clues as to the modern situation of chiefs and kings in relation to main-
stream churches in the Anglophone part of the Cameroon Grassfields is not easy to pursue
without the kind of fieldwork which allows one to test consistency between spoken norms
and the actual conduct of affairs by both sides. But I am inclined to listen carefully to a
European colleague, Hans Kn-pfli, who during thirty years of work in the Grassfields as an
organiser of church schools and pioneer of "fair trade" exports of village handicrafts to first
world purchasers, also accepted appointment to exective traditional office in Bali Nyonga
and Bamessing/Nsei. In reply to a recent question from me he wrote "that social harmony
is one of the highest values in Grassland culture, and one which, when serious breaches of
harmony occur, requires sacrifice for restoration." No doubt the situation in the Cameroon
Grasslands is in some ways differently nuanced compared with that in Ghana. But the pres-
ence of the same lack of fit between chieftaincy and church can be sensed, and with it a
largely unknown history of decades of multi-level tensions and searches for accommodation
between the two sides.
The range of unresolved questions in relations between church and traditional state,
no doubt changing over time, must have touched the daily lives of the inhabitants of the
regions of Ghana and Cameroon discussed here for generations. Outsiders often scarcely
realise that this is a problematic area. Sometimes, however, it can present itself in unexpected
ways, as when the the chief of Agogo in Asante, on an official inter-Governmental visit to
Switzerland in 1999 (he was also the Ghanaian Minister of Culture at the time), asked to be
received by the Mission 21 leadership. In the old Mission's administrative Holy of Holies-
the Basel Mission Komiteezimmer or Board Room-he asked to be brought a tray with a
jug of water, a glass, and a large plate. With these he poured libation, calling on the name of
God, on the names of his ancestors, and of missionaries who are well-known in the history
of his town.'9 This was his main "message" in the Mission House, and has to be interpreted
as a powerful appeal, in a traditional mode, to the European "mother institution" of the

Presbyterian Church of Ghana to be open to a renewed discussion of the incorporation of
pre-Christian rites of social cohesion.
Structuring the subject matter of this paper with its intention to do justice to two dif-
ferent regions and their traditional polities, whilst also reflecting on the application of visual
sources to the specific question of church-state relations, has of course not proved easy. I
begin with a cursory statement of the history of the Basel Mission and its photography in
Ghana and Cameroon, and continue with the definition and in-depth contemplation of what
I consider a genre of missionary portraits of kings and chiefs in the Cameroon Grassfields
during the Inter-War Period reflecting-to anticipate my results-the open interaction of
two different categories of office-holders, kings/chiefs and missionaries. I then compare
those findings with the portraits of kings and chiefs taken by Basel missionaries in the years
before 1914 in Cameroon, especially those taken by a lady of unusual talent, which help to
define, by comparison, the characteristics of the genre of the inter-war period there. Finally
I turn to photographs from Ghana, and pursue with those holdings the themes which have
arisen with the holdings from Cameroon.
The Basel Mission and its Photography in West
Africa: A Chronological Summary
According to the website statistics of the Basel Mission photo collection there are 1,200
"hits" when a search is made for Ghanaian and Cameroonian images with the keywords
"king" and "chief," 65 percent of them Cameroonian images, 35 percent Ghanaian.2° There
is a certain paradox in the way that the number from Cameroon is larger than that from
Ghana , since the first pertinent photograph from a Basel missionary in Ghana dates back
to the late 1860s,21 and the earliest from the Cameroon Grassfields to only 1902.22 The dif-
ference can partly be ascribed to the different historical trajectories of the Basel Mission in
Ghana and Cameroon, and partly to the increasing ease with which photographs could be
taken over time.
The Basel Mission first sent missionaries to Ghana in 1828.23 In the 1850s it was es-
tablishing inland stations in what is now the Eastern Region of Ghana, moving into Asante
when that state became accessible to mission work in 1896. It participated in the coming of
the high colonial period in the early twentieth century as a provider of schools, and through
its Trading Company's involvement in the export of cocoa.24 During the First World War,
however, the Basel Mission and its Trading Company were expelled from this British colony.
The Trading Company was allowed to return after the war under specific conditions which
included a full separation of the two organizations. The missionaries were allowed back in
limited numbers only in the mid-1920s, at first under the tutelage of the Scottish Mission,
and in any case in the context of an African church, newly established with formal indepen-

dence, which entitled itself "Presbyterian." It was perhaps something of a coincidence that
none of the post-1928 missionaries in Ghana seem to have been passionate photographers-
or at least, that none of them are known as passionate photographers in the Basel Mission
archive (there may well still be family holdings of photographs from that period which are
not known publicly). But the missionaries were much smaller in number than they had been
in Ghana before the First World War, and smaller in number than the Basel Missionaries in
Cameroon in the interwar period. Post-1914 photographs from Ghana are, therefore, rela-
tively few and not a body which can keep pace qualitatively with the photographs reviewed
in this article.
Before 1914, on the other hand, the Ghana archive contains the production of some
notable photographers. The two earliest ones, Wilhelm Locher2 and Christian Hornberger,26
did not leave us many images, not surprisingly in view of the amount of complicated hand-
work with chemicals involved in producing a negative and a print in the 1860s. Two later
ones, Fritz Ramseyer27 and Rudolf Fisch,28 were active with a camera from the late 1880s to
about 1910. They have left us large numbers of interesting and good quality photographs
and in the case of Ramseyer a group of images from chiefs' courts in Kwahu which are prob-
ably to be regarded as a very important documentation of chiefs' self-presentation and the
ornaments displayed by their entourages in the years immediately before their incorporation
in the British colony.29
Cameroon became a German colony only in 1885, and in that year the German gov-
ernment urged the Basel Mission to take over the work on the coast (Victoria and Duala)
started by the British Baptist Missionary Society. It was only at the beginning of the twenti-
eth century that the missionaries reached the Grassfields. The enthusiasm for photography
there in the decade and a half before the First World War probably had to do with the ex-
citement of discovery. The region between the Cameroon coast and Lake Chad had been
assigned to Germany in the international negotiations of the 1880s, but it was only from the
mid-1890s that German colonial officers began to move far enough inland to make contact
with the spectacular Grassfields kingdoms and they thus became known to the German-
speaking public. In this first contact situation two kingdoms in particular pursued a policy
of attracting government, mission, and commercial Europeans to their territories to serve
their own purposes-Bamrnum and Bali Nyonga. In both the Basel Mission opened a mission
station.
But to see the notable photographic oevreswhich developed in these two kingdoms be-
fore 1914-15 only in terms of their impact with the public "at home" would be superficial.
The harvest of photographs from Bali Nyonga is of enough anthropological significance to
have been the subject of intensive study by Richard Fardon in his monograph on the king-
dom's annual Lela festival, and reflects the way pre-1914 Basel Mission photography was
very much orientated to the theological discipline of Religious Studies.30 As for the much
larger kingdom of Bamum: there the King seems to have understood quickly that photogra-

phy was a new and very effective medium for spreading the news of his power and majesty.
As we have seen, Christraud Geary made "German colonial photography at the court of
King Njoya" (including the work of Basel missionaries) the subject of a landmark exhibition
in the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art in 1988.31 One particularly talented
missionary-cum-writer-cum-photographer, Anna Wuhrman, created a broad, dignified, and
anmutig (appealing) photographic portrait of inhabitants of the Bamum capital, Fumban, in
the years immediately before the seizure of the kingdom by British and French forces dur-
ing the First World War.32 Geary has repeatedly shown that the body of photography from
Bamum before 1914 can yield good results to an anthropological analysis. But in the case
of Bamum I think it is true that a major motivation for mission photography was a joint
wish among missionaries and the King to make the quality of life and rule in Fumban, the
Bamum capital, known in Europe. The King had his eyes partly on the German political and
commercial elite. But both King and missionaries will have understood the role of the Basel
Mission as a popular movement in South-West Germany and in Switzerland in support for
the Basel Mission's presence in his kingdom.
As in Ghana the Basel Mission was expelled from Cameroon during the First World
War, and was never allowed back into what became Francophone Cameroon, being re-
placed there by the Paris Mission.33 This meant that the involvement with Bamum was
broken off-and indeed the defeat and expulsion of its German Christian allies undoubtedly
played a major role in the Kingdom's adoption of Islam as its main religious identity, during
and immediately after the First World War. The Basel Mission was allowed back into those
parts of the British mandate area, however where it had been working before the War, and
which now correspond to the North-West and South-West Provinces of Cameroon. And
Anglophone Cameroon quickly became its major area of emphasis in Africa, with energetic
efforts at pioneering work in setting up congregations and schools precisely in the territories
of the Grassfields kingdoms and chiefdoms. The number of photographs taken in the area
in the inter-war period was correspondingly high and photography as an activity taken up, as
we shall see, by several missionaries.
Defining a Genre: Basel Mission Portraits of
Grassfield Chiefs in the Inter-War Period
Getting a handle on the large number of photographs possibly relevant for this study is not
easy. My tendency right at the beginning of preparatory work for this paper was to concen-
trate on the kind of image which is presumably closest to the relations between missionaries
and chiefs/kings-the portralt. After looking at a large number of photographs I decided
to begin with the relatively unknown body of images from the Cameroon Grassfields in the
inter-war period, partiy in order not to be pre-determined in my analysis by Ramseyer and
Anna Wuhrmann as major figures in the Basel Mission photographic history we have just

reviewed-and in order, too, to bring into prominence missionary photographers who have
not yet been the subject of close attention.34 And after having defined that first theoreti-
cal focus I know no other methodology than browsing through the relevant holdings of
photographs, contemplating them, thinking about them, envisaging the situation in which
a photograph was taken both from the point of view of those behind and in front of the
camera, and gradually getting a feeling for the different thematic groupings and analytical
issues which seem to be coming up. The process, of course, needs to be repeated and refined
with each body of images one selects-first impressions can be misleading (see the commen-
taries on figures 5.9 and 5.10, 5.11, and 5.12). In this case I identified twenty-eight images
which one could put under the heading of "portraits of chiefs/kings from the Cameroon
Grassfields in the inter-war period." This group shades over in one direction into a category
where the photographer seemed more interested in Grassfields' architecture than in the
people inhabiting the buildings. In another direction it shades over into a group of images
showing chiefs attending Sunday services or Mission Festivals. But a good two-thirds of
these "portraits of chiefs" seemed to me to justify the definition of a common genre which
describes the way in which the photographer went about his work-and the chief/king
presented himself. Figures 5.1 to 5. 4 are the examples and reference-points for this genre
which I now discuss.35

I suggest that that the genre I am identifying shows five characteristics:
*    The images are clearly portraits of individuals, and not depictions of types, in this
case of typical office-holders.
0    They are close-ups, or semi-close-ups. With the exception of figure 5.4 (a chief with
entourage and the ornaments some carry), they all tend, more in some portraits, less in
others, toward intimacy and informality. Members of the chief's entourage are some-
times present, but this does not reduce the impact of the image as a portrait of a single
person.
*    They are at most only minimally posed. The spontaneity with which the subjects look
at the camera strongly suggests that the photographs are not solely "designed" by the
photographer. Rather they look like products of a personal, reciprocal relationship
between photographer and subject which is, on the whole, not conflictual. The facial
expressions are often "speaking," rather than being immobile or relaxed, and therefore
seem generated, at least to an equal degree, by the subject.
0    All are seated (except for figure 5.1, where it is not immediately clear whether the chief
is seated or leaning). But the objects on which the chiefs are sitting are in all but one
case covered and evidently of no importance to the photograph, although this is a region
with a strong culture of elite Stools.6 It is true that in figure 5.3 we are given a good view

of a large and handsome leopard stool, but the intimacy of the portrait reduces the stool
with its formal hierocratic significance almost to the level of the incidental. The emphasis
is again on the personalities of the chiefs, not their exotic settings.
The portraits are characterized by a levelgaze between chief and camera-or better,
between the chief and the person behind the camera (or: the person organizing the
taking of the picture).37
Looking again at the twenty-eight images, having formulated these characteristics, I should
agree that the gaze is not always level. One head-and-shoulders portrait shows a man look-
ing slightly upwards under a creased brow-but the caption calls him a "sub-chief," and he
was perhaps well-practiced in securing space for independent thought and action which a
level-gaze relationship with his superior might tend to limit.38 Another shows the same man
as figure 5.3 but in a much less friendly mode, glancing out of the corner of his eye away
from the camera.39 But on the whole the characteristics stand up to examination. There is
one portrait of a chief sitting alone taken from above in a somewhat distant shot, which
might be taken to indicate that a photographer was depicting him as a weak and isolated
non-Christian antagonist. But this photograph was immediately followed by a semi-close-
up, still taken somewhat from above, but in which the chief is definitely looking the camera
in the eye with no indication of weakened self-assurance.40
What do these characteristics add up to, or signify? And how far can this definition of
a genre add a new emphasis based on visual sources to analyses of the relations between mis-
sionaries and chiefs based on verbal sources?
We do need to recall that we are talking about a colonial situation. But indications of
a hierarchy imposed by the photographer are absent. And I have seen no sign, among the
subjects, of being forced into having their photograph taken, or worse, of fearing they would
lose soul to the camera, that colonial legend about African primitiveness which crops up still
in generalizations about photography and about which, in my opinion, severe doubt is ap-
propriateY.4 Indeed, there is photographic evidence (figures 5.5 and 5.6) that in this period
the photographing missionary had more or less become a part of the furniture in Cameroon
Grassland chieftaincies and kingdoms. In figure 5.5 he is being largely ignored. In figure 5.6
he is the object of the kind of benign witticisms of which most of us who have lived in any
African country for any length of time have been the frequent object, and which we mostly
learned to enjoy ourselves-if we understood them.
In dealing with the Basel Mission's Cameroon photographs it is always important to
refer back to Christraud Geary's work and here two recent publications-both about the
spread of photography as an African activity in the period under discussion-are critically
relevant. Her 2004 essay stresses the importance of the photographic subject as author in
photography in Africa, and urges a focus on linkages of all members of colonial society
through their continual interactions, in interpreting the images we study. This is congruent

with the kind of analysis I am attempting here. But she then goes on to write that there is
"a common African convention of looking directly into the camera," a formulation which
challenges the significance I lay on my criterion 5.42 The level gaze I perceive would, in her
eyes, not be particularly remarkable. If criterion 5 loses profile, however, the intimacy of the
portraits (criterion 2) and above all the spontaneity of the facial expressions (criterion 3) fall
more heavily on the scales. At the moment I am not aware of relevant studies of facial expres-
sions in photographic material relevant to this discussion of Cameroon in the inter-war years,
or even of the coming of the "presentation smile" in West African portrait photography. But
the expressions on the chiefs' faces, while not relaxed, do not correspond simply to the fixed
intentional smile. It is much more as if photographer and chief were in conversation before
and after the shutter moved; hence my referring to the "speaking expression" on their faces.
And my continued assertion that these are portraits arising from a reciprocal relationship.
In spite of its open-archive policy the Basel Mission has proved, because of its German
language and script, very opaque for most people researching Anglophone Cameroon in
the inter-war period. But we are fortunate in having the recent SOAS dissertation referred
to above-still, sadly, unpublished-which tackles the development of the Basel Mission's
successor church as an African church in the inter-war period. Guy Thomas's chapter on
relationships between missionaries and chiefs is the most direct way of approaching the ques-
tion whether the definition of this genre can add to a general historical study in a way verbal
sources cannot.43 Thomas's complex pattern of sources--documents in the Basel Mission

archive in Basel, and the Presbyterian Church archive in Buea which he himself helped to
build up, plus interviews conducted in Cameroon-offers an unsuperficial history of conflict
and co-operation between chiefs and traditionalists in the Grassfields and the Basel Mission
communities (missionaries, local Mission employees, and congregations). As he writes, local
solutions had to be found to local clashes of authority between the two sides. But the verbal
sources are, in my opinion, biased towards reporting on conflict. Serious conflicts, of course,
occurred, and they generated-and in interviews may well still generate-their own com-
mitted partisan documentation on the Christian side. But one can also trace in the impor-
tance of key words like "persecution" both in manuscript originals and in published reports,
the appeal made by the Basel Mission in Basel to its supporters at home to maintain their
financial support for "threatened" congregations even during years when they themselves
were suffering economic depression and political upheaval. All that took place in a context
in which the Basel Mission, as a mainstream Protestant missionary society, had, as we have
said, no pattern of thought about the religious underpinnings of an African state other than
blanket condemnation. In other words, missionaries had a threefold motivation to report to
Basel mainly about conflict: the conflicts themselves, the need to appeal for support, and the
difficulty of reporting about rapprochements with traditional authorities which the fathers
of orthodoxy in Basel would view with skepticism.

At the conclusion of his chapter with its emphasis on conflict, however, Dr. Thomas
suggests that eventually "a reformed mode of interaction emerged between chiefs, their sub-
jects, and the [Basel Mission's] sub-clergy."4 He offers some indications to suggest that this
indeed happened. And his experiences in Cameroon will have suggested that a change of this
kind must have taken place. But there are methodological problems in using verbal sources
to work on the theme of this rapprochement. There is not only the potential hostility of
readers in the Mission House in Basel inhibiting open reporting on this subject. There is also
the point that compromises between "church" and "state" will have been essentially local,
special to each of the many king- or chiefdoms, and negotiated orally in a local language. If
I am correct in thinking that we can talk about a genre of portraits from this period centred
on the level gaze and spontaneous exchange between individual chiefs and representatives of
the Basel Mission, this would be a strong visual indication that conflict by no means domi-
nated relations with chiefs at this time. Thus we can argue that flexible relations, based on
mutual respect and interest, were a major part of the Grassfields life of the Basel Mission's
church-that Dr. Thomas's "reformed mode of interaction" really did develop in the inter-
war period, and that we have here portraits which suggest the kind of relationships in which
his new "reformed" consensus on relations between "church" and "state" grew.
Pre-War Mission Photography in Bamum in Relation to
Post-War Grassfields Portraits Of Kings and Chiefs45
Anna Wuhrmann was one of the most prolific of the Basel Mission's Grassfields photogra-
phers, and the one most published at the time the photographs were being taken.46 As we
shall see she also introduced a very new quality into the images from the Grassfields circulat-
ing among missionaries and their supporters. She first arrived in Bamum in 1911.47 She was
expelled with the arrival of the British and French forces in this part of Cameroon in mid-
1915. She did return for a brief period after the war, loaned to the Paris Mission as it took
over Basel Mission work in Bamum, and she thus experienced the hostility which Njoya had
developed to Christianity.48 But the bulk of her photography dates from the early months
of 1915 or earlier, when there were mostly cordial relations between "church" and "state,"
and the Basel Mission clearly occupied a favoured position in Bamum's response to German
colonisation, and in what we could very well call its modernisation policies.
Although Christraud Geary devoted a chapter to Anna Wuhrmann in the guide to her
Smithsonian exhibition in 1988,49 the definitive work on Wuhrmann's Fumban photography
remains to be written. In particular a series of about 70 notes on individual images which she
herself composed in 1917, apparently as a script in case these images would be used by the
Basel Mission in public slide shows, was found in an attic in the Mission House in Basel after
Geary's exhibition (for figure 5.8 see the full English translation of one of those notes in

the appendix to this chapter.)5 And the intensive correlation of information about persons
in Bamum which would be possible between her photographs, the Basel Mission's general
archive, and Wuhrmann's own monographs remains, as I write, an unfulfilled dream.
Anna Wuhrmann's particular field of innovation was the portrait. We do not know
what sort of camera or film she used, but the shading she achieved in capturing fight fall-
ing on dark skins is often strikingly beautiful. Her portraits largely document people from
Njoya's court and its immediate environs. They vary from full-length depictions of her
subjects as individuals or as groups to close-ups of individuals. Her most innovative work
was done with head-and-shoulder close-up portraits, often of women, utilizing a variety of
camera angles, both in the vertical and the horizontal planes. In contrast to the genre docu-
mented above, the straight and level gaze is only one of many possible relationships between
camera and subject in her work.
Christraud Geary was evidently very touched by Wuhrmann's images, and summed up
the impact they made on her in sentences which have lodged in my mind, and are as fresh
now as when I first saw them almost twenty-five years ago:
Only one photographer [in Fumban] transcended the prescribed relationship be-
tween the photographer and the photographic subject and thus overcame the limi-
tation inherent in the ethnographic way of picturing the Other. Anna Wuhrmann,
a missionary teacher, developed close friendships with the Bamum people. In her
photography she focussed on people and their personalities, creating strikingly inti-
mate images that are almost modern in their conception.51
Two points in this judgment are important in connection with the analysis I am at-
tempting here. First of all Geary is, I think, quite correct to emphasize Wuhrmann as the
main active factor in the taking of the photographs ("... she focused on people and their
personalities... ."). Indeed, it was after looking at the Wuhrmann portraits, with the camera
angles carefully chosen, and sensitive use of light, that I extended the list of genre character-
istics of portraits of chiefs in the interwar period to include the elements of level gaze and
spontaneous co-control by those portrayed in the way the photographs worked out, in con-
tradistinction to Wuhrmann's style. Wuhrmann usually took photographs of relaxed faces,
where the later portraitists seem to have encouraged spontaneous facial expressions in their
subjects.
Secondly, the word "friendship" is vital to Geary's judgment, but difficult to parse.
There is no indication that Geary is using the term "friendship" in any specific social science
way. Nor is she referring to any codified relations of friendship, like the "Duzfreundschaften"
she will have experienced as a young adult in her German home. She is writing about some-
thing difficult to define and insert into a social science discussion-mutual interest, empathy,
and enjoyment. There is, perhaps, a subtext here. My feeling is that "friendship" is sym-
metrical in this judgment to the observation that Wuhrmann had overcome the limitations
"in the ethnographic approach to the Other." Geary needed a term to describe Wuhrmann's

127

PAUL JENKINS

relations with the people she photographed which represented liberation from social theory
and the colonial gaze, and found it in "friendship." At all events "friendship" indicates an
open unstructured element in her relationships with her Fumban subjects.
Wuhrmann is pivotal to evaluating Basel Mission photographs linked to kings and
chiefs in the Grassfields in the sense that, as we discuss below, we can be confident she influ-
enced the Mission photographers of the inter-war years in Cameroon. But she is also pivotal
in the sense that Geary included Wuhrmann's male colleagues who photographed before
1914 as being part of the much more restricted approach to photography which Wuhrmann
had left behind her. This latter assertion is not altogether easy to expound. Yes, the male
colleagues selected a somewhat different pattern of photographic subjects-rural and urban
views, architecture, mixed groups of missionaries and local notables, especially the King
(figure 5.7). But their subjects do overlap with Wuhrmann's: they photograph some family
groups, and there are some portraits of individuals. It is when we look at the group portraits
taken by the male missionaries that we begin to see a difference, which presumably had a lot
to do with gender issues. Eugene Schwarz52 and Martin Gdhring53 took portraits of groups
and even individuals, but they stop well short of the quality which Wuhrmann brought to
this work.

Figure 5.8: "Nkpundia, a wife of the King,

Leaving aside her own specific gifts as a photographer and a human being, Wuhrmann,
one can argue, had two advantages when it came to attempting and carrying through her
series of intimate portraits. She was not without responsibility as a missionary. But she was
a woman, and her responsibilities were limited and sectorial, to do with education for girls.
True, conflict might occur between a woman teacher and the leaders of this polity about
who her girls were going to marry. Many young women were apparently assigned by the
King to marry particular men, especially those who were notionally related to the King-
an important source of royal power and influence.54 But the general impression given by
Wuhrmann's writings and portraits is that she was a welcome source of innovative impulses
in Bamum among her pupils, their mothers, their fathers and their potential husbands, and
a welcome bridge into personally experiencing contact with the European power which had
invaded the Bamum world.55
The male missionaries, on the other hand, had to carry the full responsibility for run-
ning a mission according to Basel instructions, while achieving daily compromises with local
society.56 And, of course, in the eyes of the German colonial government in Cameroon-
with whom the Basel Mission's relations were anything but consistently harmonious (in
1907 Basel missionaries played a role in the agitation which led to the dismissal of Governor
von Puttkamer)-it was the male staff of the Basel Mission who were regarded as being re-
sponsible for what went on, and not their wives or unmarried female assistants.

PAUL JENKINS

Wuhrmann's pivotal importance to the history of Basel Mission photography in the
setting of the Grassfields kingdoms and chiefdoms has thus to do with her achievement of
a breakthrough into taking portraits showing a radically increased sense of intimacy with
those portrayed. It is interesting to be able to go on from there to remark that real set-
piece racially-mixed group portraits with missionaries and, for example, the King, are rare
in Wuhrmann's oevre, but an important part of the photographs by Gohring and Schwarz.
But the mens' mixed group portraits of missionaries and local leaders seem more to have the
character of portrayals of official relations, however informal the meetings may seem at first
sight (figure 5.7).57
The male photographers who produced the portraits of chiefs in the inter-war period
we have examined may well, in this context, have been influenced to attempt a closer and
more informal style of photography by Wurhmann's example. But the regularity with which
they record that level gaze is almost certainly not merely a difference between a simple and
a complex aesthetic vocabulary. Perhaps their relationships with their subjects were less mul-
tivalent than hers. However much the portraits reflect a reciprocal personal relationship it
was always, also, seemingly a relationship between two classes of office-holders who might
perhaps clash in discharging of their responsibilities.
Incorporating the Photographs from Ghana in This Analysis
We turn now to the photographs of kings and chiefs from Ghana in the Basel Mission ar-
chive. Taken overall the largest category of images relevant to this paper-something like
half of the photographs of kings and chiefs from both before and after the First World
War-shows subjects in one of two familiar traditional formations. In one a chief/king and
his male subjects are arranged for an audience in a steeply angled isosceles triangle, with the
short side open, and the chief/king sitting at the apex opposite the open side (figures 5.9
and 5.10, and in a more elaborate form figures 5.11 and 5.12). In the other the chief/king is
in motion. He may be on foot, escorted by a small group and shaded by an umbrella. Or he
may be in a much larger formation on a festival occasion, being carried in a palanquin. In all
three of these formations, groups of servants and supporters are present in their appropriate
places. During a formal audience, or when he is being carried in a palanquin, his umbrella
carrier is present, as are "souls" with their gold ornamental plates hanging on their chests,
carriers of ceremonial state swords, bodyguards, drummers, stool- and palanquin carriers,
and "linguists".58
An interesting question arises. Comparing the portraits of chiefs/kings and their en-
tourages in southern Ghana in this collection with those from the Cameroon Grassfields,
it looks as if the life of chief's or kings' courts was much less subject to a set choreography
of varied office-holders in the Cameroon Grassfields than in the Akan world. Indeed, if we
were to look for genres in the photography of chiefs and kings taken by Basel missionaries

PORTRAITS OF AKAN AND CAMEROONIAN GRASSFIELD KINGS AND CHIEFS

in Ghana the predominant ones, as I have suggested here, are determined by "traditional"
and indigenous formality. The kind of spontaneity which I have tried to demonstrate is im-
portant in the body of mission photographs of Cameroonian chiefs in the inter-war period
is absent or very weak in this large group of Ghanaian photographs.59
This group of photographs is dominated by indigenous formality that shades over into
individuals or multiples, and of these often nontraditional, portraits of kings or chiefs, their
spouses, or immediate relatives. But even here the relationship between camera and subject
is distanced. The missionary photographers almost always use that distance to show the sub-
jects full-figure. I have found only two head-and-shoulder portraits of kings or chiefs. One
is a portrait of the Chief of Agogo, who had special relations with the Basel Mission as the
donor of land for their mission hospital in his capital.60 The other is a portrait of the "King
of Kumase," i.e., the former king of Asante, who had returned as a Christian from an exile-
mostly in the Seychelles-which had begun in 1896 and ended in 1924.61 Both subjects will
have had their special reasons for agreeing to a more intimate style of photograph in this case
than was otherwise usual.
The main point where photographs of kings and chiefs in the Basel Mission holdings
on Ghana show a degree of congruence with the Cameroon genre as defined above is in the

way the camera and its subject exchange level glances. The persons responsible for taking the
photographs seem certainly not to have attempted to use camera angles to assert a morally
or culturally superior position for Basel missionaries. This even applies to Fritz Ramseyer,
a spade-bearded pioneer missionary of the first water.62 And on their side the chiefs-and
their entourages-look at or near the camera, on the level, resolutely, but to a degree very
different from that of the Cameroonian chiefs in figures 1 to 4 the images are the opposite
of intimate. The whole ensemble stresses, it seems to me, distance and difference.
Kings, Chiefs, and Missionaries: Further Indications
of the Encounter Behind the Photographs
It is clear that Basel missionaries invested time, inventiveness, and, probably from the late
nineteenth century onwards, their own money in taking photographs of chiefs, kings, and
their immediate environments.63 And it is clear that many chiefs and kings co-operated in
this. Easy explanations of this situation which would be generally accepted in the modern
West are not hard to formulate. Chiefs and kings in areas where the Basel Mission worked
were spectacular symbols of the exotic setting in which mission was taking place, and in
Germany (where the majority of Basel Mission supporters lived) monarchical sentiment
and interest in distant kings remained high. The photographs were perhaps made simply to

authenticate what the Basel missionaries were doing, and to stimulate monetary contribu-
tions. First impressions of photographs in the Basel Mission collection can however be very
misleading and often only confirm existing Western prejudices and biases. Seeking an orien-
tation in terms of the local context, where the photographs were taken, is essential if we are
to take the pictures' subjects seriously.
Taking all three groups together we have first of all confirmation of the assertion from
first principles, with which I began this essay. Missions-and-churches, and chieftaincy, in
these two regions were indeed bound in intricate and long-lasting relationships. These were
partly and fundamentally relations of conffict, but the quality of the photographic record
would emphasize rather the element of negotiation and adjustment. Thinking about the
situation in which both sides found themselves, we can also consider that this was a relation-
ship in which both sides explored the other, in which for both sides the other was a reference
point for understanding a major external presence in a complicated and confusing world.
For the missionaries, in particular, the photographic record would tend to indicate that
kings, chiefs, and their courts were places where authoritative answers, in the broadest sense,
could be had to questions concerning cultural and social relationships about which in their
early years in a region they would have been ignorant. For the missionaries, kings, chiefs, and
their entourages personified the culture they upheld.

Fligure 5.12. "King of Akropong with all the chiefs," photographer unknown.

For instance, the archive records a commentary on figure 5.3 which explains that the
photographer "understands how to win [the] trust" of the king in the photograph. "He
maintained close contact with him, told him exactly what he would be preaching to his
people, and, after every journey [there] he reported in detail what he had experienced."'64
Translated into non- mission- centric language this is a clear indication that this king was fully
informed orally about the activities of the missionary in his kingdom. The missionary briefed
him on arrival. I would then use the formulation that the King debriefed the missionary
before his departure. In any case we can be sure that the conversations were not one-sided,
that the missionary will have gained decisive insights into the organization and ethics-the
culture-of Banso through this contact.
In the same way, after study of figures 5.9 and 5.10, I argue that Fritz Ramseyer was
not simply following a Western choreography and preaching to the Chief of Obomeng and
his (male) people, however much the missionary gesture recorded by the camera may have
been intended to give that impression to European eyes, as was the information Ramseyer
himself published about the picture (see the comment on figure 5.9). He will have been
placing himself in principle in the choreography of statements and replies in an Akan chief's
or king's court, in which a chief's "linguist" (okyeame) will have communicated the visitor's
concern to the chief and his entourage in a rephrased and repeated form, and after discus-

sion the linguist's formulation of what had been decided was the decisive communication
to the visitor. I would also argue that such contacts played a large role in the way missionar-
ies learned about their cultural environment and its specific implications for whatever they
intended to do or communicate. Of course, it may be that what is propagated nowadays
as a fundamentally unchanging custom centred on the role of the "linguist" is a modern
"invention of tradition," but having found a nineteenth-century linguist's staff in figure
5.10. I am strongly inclined to argue that what I was told in southern Ghana was normal
and ancient etiquette in a chief's court will have applied to these encounters.65 It is clear that
their involvement in indirect rule formalized aspects of chieftaincy in Ghana. But very early
photographs in the Basel Mission collection-photographs, like these from Kwahu, which
can with some justice be categorized as pre-colonial rather than colonial-repeat what are
now familiar Akan court formations, like that in figure 5.10.
Having raised this point, other broader considerations and patterns of information can
be brought into relation to the photographs discussed here. We have already seen that Guy
Thomas argues that the central point of relations between missionaries and their Cameroon
colleagues on the one side, and chiefs and kings on the other, was a question of "mutual
recognition, tolerance or defiance," and that co-existence between "'traditional' customs
and Christian values had to be [or better, were being] negotiated."66
In relation to Ghana, Michelle Gilbert and I in a recent publication comment on docu-
ments pertaining to a sharp conflict between the king of Akwapim and the Basel Mission
Church in 1900, which demonstrates how much expertise had been gathered by the two sides
about each other in sixty years of the Basel Mission presence in the state capital, Akropong.67
This conflict was about the terms to be observed if a certain king's "Soul" was to be allowed
to resign from his traditional duties and become a frill member of the church.68 The crucial
point in relation to the argument of this article is that both sides-"church" and "state"-
sought to defend themselves and manipulate the other by reference to rules and regulations
prevalent on the other side of the dispute. This became most clear during fierce arguments
about the ex-soul's marriage status, which was linked to the question of the disposal of the
man's estate in the event of his death (he was a wealthy merchant, elderly and childless,
and had been seriously ill). The king's knowledge of Christian ethics and congregational
rules was extensive, and he incorporated them in his attempt to steer the church towards
agreeing that one of the King's own female relatives should be acknowledged as having the
right to be the man's single Christian wife. But the church responded by citing traditional
procedures which had linked the man to another women in what was to be regarded as his
primary formal traditional marriage, which gave that woman the right to be regarded as his
single Christian wife.69 The king, in the traditional way, had accepted the role of witness to
that marriage by accepting "drinkables" at the time this news was passed to him. He could
scarcely now cast serious doubt on the existence and validity of this other marriage.

Such detailed and concrete insights into the relations between the Basel Mission and
traditional authorities in West Africa are not easy to find, but once one considers-in situa-
tions of conflict or as part of normal discussions between the two sides-that issues like these
were a matter of constant negotiation, then it becomes quite plausible that kings' and chiefs'
courts were central reference points for the missionaries' growing cultural competence.
Jan Vansina's Paths in the Rainforests can be read to emphasize how all human com-
munities have centres of intellectual articulation in which new problems are perceived and
examined, common opinions developed as to their nature, and common solutions discussed
and attempted.70 Here it was the kingdoms and chiefdoms that acted as centres of intellec-
tual articulation. Indeed, one could argue that they consciously understand themselves as
centres of excellence in competition with other, similar centres.71
Such centres may well have been interested in gaining the adherence of persons of
unusual gifts, incorporating people with desired talents even though they may have no claim
to such a position of leadership through descent. The Nkom in the court of the Fon of Bali
Nyonga in the Cameroon Grassfields-a state which, as we have seen, played an important
part in Basel Mission history in this region-are appointed ad personam for their talents, for
instance. Using visual sources we can almost certainly recognise that at least one missionary
in the early stages of contact with the Basel Mission was enrobed as an Nkom; so it seems
thirty years later was a non-Bali pastor who was becoming influential in the area.72 Quite
unambiguously a modern Swiss colleague, Hans Kn6pfli, has been enrobed as Nkom three
decades ago, and found the exercise of this office offered a fascinating view of the kingdom
as it faced the changing modern world.73 In this case the kingdom had a form of flexibility
which integrated talented people in its structures at a leadership level, and seems to have
sought such leaders in the Basel Mission and its church in that regard, although with limited
success.
Here attention has been drawn to the key role of the Akan "linguist" or translator
(akyeame), noting that they may have been appointed for their talents rather than simply
because of their membership in a particular lineage. The history of linguists with a Christian
background in Akan traditional courts has not, as far as I know, been much noticed.74 There
are indications that the incorporation of people from Christian congregations for the sake
of their talents and experience takes this and other forms neither familiar to the general
historiography of this part of Africa, nor present in its formal church history. Consider this
extended comment by a Ghanaian pastor in Akropong in the early twentieth century:
If it should also be asked, in what degree does our native government interfere with
our Christian religion? we should remark that considering that at least two-thirds of
the [rulers] are Christians (excluded [from Communion services) whose conduct
and mode of ruling ought to have been consistent to the religion they had [previ-
ously] professed and [is] not. ., it interferes in a great measure...

PORTRAITS OF AKAN AND CAMEROONIAN GRASSFIELD KINGS AND CHIEFS

The king... is a Christian who was educated in our mission schools till as far as
to our seminary....[The]Commander in Chief of all Akwapim is a Christian....
one of the three principal linguists is a Christian ... the principal chiefs, the chiefs
of Aburi and the chief of Larteh also are Christians .... [although these] stick closely
to the old heathenish mode of government.., some of [them attend] regularly the
divine services.... and at home on their tables you will find... open Bibles.75
A large part of the "traditional" leadership of Akwapim was provided by men who
had formerly been frill church members and trained catechists and teachers. For the Pastor
writing his report to the fathers of orthodoxy in Basel, it was inconceivable that Christianity
could co-exist with belief in the continuing influence of the ancestors and with participation
in traditional sacrifices.76 And yet he tells that many of those he lists were Bible-readers and
attended church regularly. The interaction between the Basel Mission community and the
traditional state was intense and lasting. With Middleton's periodisation of relations between
church and state in Akwapim to hand, I would argue that the grouped chiefs and sub-chiefs
under their umbrellas in figures 5.11 and 5.12 are a part of Akwapim church history. Of
course, having said that, one has to agree that they are also images which speak to the success
of the Akwapim state in drawing key Christian laymen back into a visibly traditional complex
of leadership. Effort had been evidently been expended to maintain Akwapim as a virile state
and centre of excellence, in spite of changes which were by no means under local control.
Conclusion
Historical photographs can be much more than illustrations of processes of thought based
on other classes of source.77 This study shows that historical photographs can bring new
materials and insights to existing discussions about non-photographic matters, and even
launch new directions for inquiry in them. There is always a balance of interaction between
visual and verbal sources in such analyses, which are not always the same thing. The search
to define a genre, for example, has been a strongly visual process, supported only in the
background by catalogue documentation which helps anchor images in time and space,
and ensures in case of doubt that they are "about" the theme which is under consideration.
But the final presentation of the state umbrellas of figures 5.11 and 5.12 as memorials of an
African state's church history illustrates not so much a concentration on visual sources, as a
dialectic between verbal and visual sources. The two kinds of material can work together, like
the two feet of a climber scaling a rock-chimney.
The new materials and new impulses brought to discussions in this paper are however
not easy to weigh and finally assess. The researcher also quickly becomes aware of a further
problem beyond the expected biases of the sources. The Christian world at a national and
international level, and the world of development activitists, discount the importance of
chieftaincy and presume it will die away. Outside the ranks of the chiefs and kings them-

selves, people who argue for the contemporary significance of chieftaincy for social cohesion,
are hard to find.78 If a Westerner is not interested in chieftaincy he will not hear about it in
conversation with his African partners.79
In this context the materials in this essay are first and foremost a contribution to en-
riching the texture of accounts of a relationship which is too often discussed in terms of
dichotomies, or simply neglected. The genre discussed reflects real mutuality in relations
between chief and missionary as significant local office-holders at the time, and in the region,
analysed. The pre-war Bamum photographs give the later genre more profile, though the
result of the comparison between the genre photographs and those of Anna Wuhrmann is
rather different from the comparison with those of the pre-war male missionaries' photo-
graphs. The Ghanaian photographs suggest very strongly, interpreted in their local context,
that already in the nineteenth century, relations between mission and traditional state in
Ghana were varied and complex and by no means unrelievedly negative. It is worth making
the point explicitly that twice in this paper, assertions, or hypotheses-which seemed to John
Middleton and Guy Thomas to be correct about past relations between church and state
and which were based on their own experience and reflection, but for which they had little
documentation-are given substantial support by the analyses of photographs attempted
here.
There should be no need to argue that correct knowledge of the past is important for
any human community-and that should be quite obvious in an Africa in which the percep-
tions of the past held in popular ideas about the content of oral tradition can still prove to
have uncomfortably normative value for the communities involved, especially in situations
of difficulty. In the two regions of Africa addressed in this paper churches and the traditional
state are the two most powerful and influential popular grass-roots institutions. Their rela-
tions-not forgetting the complicating background of the basic theological assessments of
the traditional state in mainstream Protestantism-are important for peace and progress.
Working to get the general understanding of their relations in the past right is definitely
worthwhile. And it is one of many themes which allow us to select groups of images from
the vast pile of historical photographs of Africa available online nowadays, images which can
stimulate our thinking, and enrich our envisioning-and thus our perception and under-
standing-of relations between the West and the African past which is some way beyond our
common Western understanding.

deemed to be non-Christian is delegated to a relative. This is very rarely done, however. The
most famous experiment of this kind was carried on by Chi Kangsen, who in the 1980s was
simultaneously, as ordained pastor, Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Cameroon, and sub-
chief of the kingdom of Wum in the Cameroon Grassland. The experiment was tragically broken
off when he was killed in a traffic accident in 1988; see Dah, Jonas N., Kangsen as they saw him

subsumed primarily under the question of the future of "ancestor worship," and not primarily
concerned with the future of African traditional states.

protestantism. The Catholic scene in Ghana is very different-see Pashington Obeng's work, for
instance his bijou essay Asante Women Dancers: Architects of Power Realignment in Corpus Christi

a powerful Ghanaian bishop who is also a trained social anthropologist. I should add that two
recent Basel doctoral theses in history whose research has been strongly focussed on the Basel

detailed statment about this genre, with a full commentated list of the portraits involved: &amp;lt;http://

36. The linkage between chieftaincy or kingship and sophisticated handicrafts is the sustained subject
of Hans Kndpfli, Craft and Technologies: Some Traditional Craftsmen of the Western Grasslands of
Cameroon, Vol. 2, Sculpture and Symbolism-Woodcarvers and Blacksmiths (Basel: Basel Mission,
1999), and Vol. 4 Living in Style-Handicrafts, Music and the Fabric of Social Life (Basel: Basel
Mission, 2002).
37. Missionaries themselves often appear (as in figure 5.9) in images where the records indicate they were
the photographers. The problem in terms of archival lists is that the source of much of this information
(lists of images received from abroad, for Ghana and Cameroon under the reference numbers D-30-
0 and E-30-0) are actually listing the names of the missionaries who sent the image to headquarters.
But in bmpix we have usually inserted this name in the field for a photographer/"creator," in the sense
that this person will usually at least have organised the taking of the photograph. He (it seems to be
always "he") can be regarded as the "producer," in a cinematographic sense. The history of the local
assistants-or missionary wives-has so far not been investigated.

I should perhaps make clear that I have become so sceptical about stories of Africans fearing to lose
soul to the camera that I demand documentation whenever I hear people citing it, and insist that
evidence of this fear has to be really convincing, linked to single incidents, and independent of a
European writer's wish to offer a titillating demonstration of African primitiveness.

subsisted between her and the court-Njoya was, indeed, sending his many daughters to
Wuhrmann's school escorted by one of his wives who Wurhmann regarded as a kind of senior
governess.
56. There is good evidence that at times the leadership in Basel feared its established missionaries in
Fumban were succumbing to the temptation to "go native" in the court of King Njoya.
57. Geary's later comment on this point (Geary, "Portraiture") stresses Wuhrmann's "strong sense of
personal style" and "overwhelming authorial presence" in her photography, and considers that, in
contrast, in G6hring's photography "the African subjects determine how they want to be seen"

portraits of Krobo chiefs stressing the innovative character of the King's clothing and accessories.

Emblems, and Statecraft in Manya Krobo (Ghana) about 1860-1939," in Quarcoopome, ed., 61-
74. Incorporating the term "genre" in our vocabulary, however, allows us to include quantitative
elements in our analyses. Thus Arlt and Quarcoopome can stress-correctly-the use of individual
portraits, and at the same time I can write about genres, and the prevailing style of photography of
chiefs and their entourages.

65. I am not arguing that this choreography will have been invariably followed, or that chiefs and kings
never spoke in public themselves, just that this was a fundamental structure of formal encounters
which missionaries will have been aware of, and will also have been aware that cordial relations
demanded a degree of adherence to these forms.

protected but could also endanger him. Their sign of office was a gold plate which hung on their
chests. For further dertails see Gilbert and Jenkins.

PORTRAITS OF AKAN AND CAMEROONIAN GRASSFIELD KINGS AND CHIEFS

69. Under the Basel Mission's rules on inheritance, since the man had no children, all his wealth
would accrue to his wife on his death and in this case therefore under the prevailing rules of the
matriliny to the Akwapim royal family. It might be added here that the "church" had a scale of
compensations a man was expected pay to a wife if he broke off the relationship by becoming
a Christian. This included a tariff for what had to be paid to a less formal wife (like the king's
female relative in this case). Such compensation payments with known tariffs as at least a basis for
discussion were a feature of the "traditional" administration of Akan justice, and taken over, it
seems, by the "church"-another sign of the closeness and interaction of the two sides.

of Bamum referred to in n48 above. Instead of giving it at least a second grade headline and
emphasising the positive aspects of an Islamic ruler "on pilgrimage" to a Christian mission house,
it offered an eye-witness account of the Sultan in the Mission 21 Archive with frequent ironical
side-references to the "Sultan" of the Walt Disney opus.
79. I experienced a recent and worrying instance of this problem at a high-level theological conference
recently at which an African speaker gave a very competent analysis of developments in the
Pentecostalist scene in his part of Africa, with no mention of the way new Pentecostalism relates to
chieftaincy there. When I approached him about this omission he turned out to possess a fund of
detailed information about this but concluded that it was not important enough to be part of his
presentation.

King Njoya receives his visitors at an entrance to his massive palace. Wives, or female servants, can be
seen at the back to the left. Note the mixed requisites, some evidently traditional, some Western, and
the presence of a camera case to the right.
From the left: the missionaries Schwarz, Lutz, King Njoya, (perhaps) the missionary Spellenberg.
Lutz is sitting on a stool carved in the shape of a leopard. The stool on right (with child climbing) looks
like Bamileke work. (Thanks to Christraud Geary and Peter Valentin.)

Date: 1911-15
Place: Fumban
This is one of the portraits to which Anna Wuhrmann wrote a commentary in 1917 (BM Archive ref.
no. E-30-0.6, image no. K 3565). Translated: "King Njoya's wife, spinning. The King's wife in our
picture is called 'I die today' [Wuhrmann does not comment on this]. She is not one of the important
wives in the court. She lives a quiet and peaceful little life and her colleague wives love her because of her
friendliness and her goodwill. Sadly this pleasant woman has no children of her own. She is not happy in
the loneliness this imposes on her, and so the King has made her the supervisor of the royal daughters.
Every morning she brings them to school. And then she, whom you might describe as a high governess,
sits in the shadow of the house waiting for her charges till teaching has finished for the day. She fills in
the time till the end of school with some small handwork-mending baskets, stringing beads, carving a
calabash. Or with amazing skill she spins a fine thread."

Original caption (translated): "Preaching before the chief of Obomeng"
Photographer: Fritz Ramseyer
Date: 1888-1895
Place: Obomeng/Kwahu
Obomeng is a sub-chiefdomin the Kwahu highlands, north of Accra and east of Kumase.
The men of Obomeng have gathered with their chief in the classical arrangement for a formal
audience. Yet Ramseyer's own commentary to this picture implies that his sense of how the encounter
with the missionary should proceed was followed. In a book of early half-tone plates of photographs he
took in Ghana, published in Neuchatel in 1895 (Achtzig Ansichten von der Goldkiiste; the French version
was Quatre-vingt vues de la Cote d'Or) he wrote: "Abankwa [the name of the chief] hearing a court case.
Important cases are sometimes heard on the street. If we come across a gathering of this kind when
we are on trek, and if the people are not too worked up, we ask them to interrupt their proceedings for
a while, which they usually do very willingly, at least in Kwahu. And we use this fine opportunity to
preach the good news of the gospel." In what is now regarded as the ancient choreography, however,
audiences of this kind would require the involvement of a so-called "Linguist" (Twi: Okyeame, plu.
Akyeame) to rephrase the visitor's message or concern in the appropriate language, and sum up for the
visitor the decision come to by the group.

PAUL JENKINS

This is clearly a close-up taken on the same occasion as figure 5.9, concentrating on chief Abankwa. It
is relevant to the question of adjusted choreographies, in the sense that a modern "Linguist" is a clearly
recognisable figure. He holds a tall linguist's staff with a wooden carving covered with gold leaf at the
top, a decoration which alludes to some traditional symbol or reminds people of one of their proverbs.
Clearly in figure 5.9 no such linguist is visible.
In this close-up, however, we see that the chief is holding the top of a simple staff without a
carved decoration-and that by his side, squatting down, someone is holding the bottom of the staff,
suggesting a linguist's staff, in common use in the nineteenth century. The implication is that the man
sitting and holding the bottom of the staff was the linguist. My argument from Akan first principles-
that the familiar choreography of the structured dialogue will have applied when missionaries appeared
before this kind of assembly-would receive an important confirmation if, as I suggest on the basis of
this image, we can be sure that a linguist was present in the group photographed.
E. TRANSFORMING OUR READING OF WHAT LOOK, AT FIRST SIGHT, LIKE IMAGES
WITH A CLEAR MESSAGE: AKW5APIM
Figure 5.11

Original caption (translated): "King of Akropong and [illegible: a Banyan Tree?]"
Photographer: unknown
Date: 1888-1914
Place: Akropong/Akwapim, Ghana
Figure 5.12
bmpix ref. no. QD-30.106.048. IMPA Record ID: impa-m55813.
Original caption (translated): "King of Akropong with all the chiefs"
Photographer: unknown
Date: 1888-1914
Place: Akropong/Akwapim, Ghana
Almost certainly these are photographs of an assembly of all the chiefs of Akwapim, each with his
umbrella. This will have been a state festival, probably part of the annual Odwira celebration. Figure
5.11 is a more general view. Figure 5.12 is a semi-close-up of the central tableau (the striped umbrella
in front on the right in figure 5.12 is the second away from the camera on the right in figure 5.11.) The
King of Akwapim is visible in figure 5.12 at the top of a step-pyramid built, no doubt, for the occasion.
The album from which these photographs were taken is linked to the name of the missionary Balthasar
Groh-Wenger, and his wife Martha. Balthasar Groh was in Ghana 1887-1913. It seems very possible that
the King is Nana Kwasi Akufo, who features in the essay by Gilbert &amp;amp; Jenkins (fn. 67). A studio portrait
of Kwasi Akufo is available at D-30.11.041.
Nothing, one might think, could be more "African" than an assembly of this kind. But the image
should be read with the report from a Ghanaian pastor, Theophilus Opoku, in mind, part of his Annual
Report for 1900. In other words many of the umbrellas will have been sheltering chiefs who had been
in Basel Mission employment when they were younger, and even at the moment the photograph was
taken, though formally excluded from the congregation for participating in "heathen" rites, they were
attending church regularly, and reading their Twi bibles.
This is in one sense, therefore, a photograph of the church history of Akwapim-certainly a
photograph belonging to a dynamic and many-sided religious history there which western academia has
always found difficult to grasp in its entirety, and which is by no means over, or finally resolved.
The figure in an aggressive pose immediately in front of the camera is a unique feature of this
ensemble and appears in no other group portrait of a chief and his entourage in the Basel Mission's
Ghana photographs. Is he an indication that the photograph was taken at the height of tension between
Kwesi Akufo and the Basel Mission Church?

Ghana, ca. 1890 to ca. 1930'
KWABENA 0. AKURANG-PARRY, DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY, SHIPPENSBURG UNIVERSITY
Introduction
t would be an honor for any historian of Africa to write a chapter of a Festschrift in
honor of David Henige. Among African historians of my generation, trained in both
Africa and overseas, especially at North American universities, the respect for Henige
is deep. Some of us came to African history with packages and flavors of oral history
excavated from ashes of the evening fireside histories as we sat at the feet of patriarchs and
matriarchs, or had the latitudinal license to stretch the stories of court jesters, griots or jeli,
and palace linguists into localized mythical stories to shape our budding historical con-
sciousnesses. The struggles to accommodate our oral histories and localized histories did not
only occur in the confines of graduate classrooms, but also in the hallowed pages of some
Africanist journals. The application of oral history challenged established historiographies
that had derived from colonial reports, touted as the efficacious models of contemporary
Western histories.
For my part, I recall how oral history, localized histories, and "Africanized" newspaper
sources whipped up my appetite for asking new questions about the roles of Africans in abo-
lition, and energized my efforts to feminize the history of emancipation in the Gold Coast.
Among several editors of African history journals only Henige recognized the new thrust of
my ideas, shaped as they were by oral history and "Africanized" sources. As a result, Henige

KWABENA O. AKURANG-PARRY

gave me great guidance in reworking my ideas for publication as a young and ambitious
graduate student. With Henige's assistance and encouragement, I was able to publish three
articles in History in Africa, the journal founded and edited by him.2 This further empow-
ered me to hone my emerging perspectives on slavery and abolition and the feminization of
post-proclamation unfree labor in the Gold Coast and Africa as a whole.
This essay is an addition to the growing body of literature on gendering abolition and
emancipation in the Gold Coast. Due to the paucity of primary sources, the present chapter
like the existing literature also deals with specific areas of the Gold Coast, namely the south-
ern regions of what is today Ghana, focusing mostly on the Central Province. It examines
the ways that the colonial state tried to assist former slaves, and to a smaller extent, liberated
pawns. Both groups constituted mostly young females in their transition from bondage to
freedom, spanning ca. 1890 and ca.1930. Principally, the essay discusses the colonial policy
of "apprenticeship" or fosterage administered by the colonial state to assist "freed slaves" in
their quest for freedom.
Raymond Dumett and Marion Johnson delineated this subject in their debate with
Gerald McSheffrey regarding the form that abolition took in the Gold Coast. Nonetheless
the core areas of the subject remain to be fully studied.' Here, I argue that the colonial
apprenticeship policy, based on the Ordinance of 1890 and enacted by the Gold Coast
Legislative Council, did not better the conditions of former slaves, mostly young females.
As a result, the apprenticeship policy facilitated the relapse of former slave children into
dependency and bondage. Among others, the apprenticeship policy in the Gold Coast pro-
vided cheap, involuntary menial labor for the elite of the colonial society, both African and
European.
Divided into several sections, the first portion of this chapter, in the tradition of Henige,
problematizes the sources, while the second part looks briefly at the aspects of the literature
relevant to the present study. The third section looks at the history of apprenticeship in the
Gold Coast from circa 1890 to about 1930. The fourth part is devoted to highlighting
inter-regional apprenticeship between the Gold Coast and Northern Nigeria. Dealing with
a biographical case study of an apprenticed former slave girl, the final section fills some gaps
and further raises some questions about the efficacy of the colonial policies of abolition and
emancipation as well as the nature of African responses and initiatives, especially the ways
that freed slaves themselves sought to adjust to freedom.
Problematizing the Sources
Historians of Africa have come a long way, sometimes along difficult methodological paths,
to embrace the use of oral history. Its use in the reconstruction of the African past is the
work of several scholars, institutions, and governmental initiatives.4 Among them Henige
has clearly mapped out unique methodological pathways of oral history in the writing of

I OFTEN SHED MY TEARS ABOUT THIS

African history.5 Henige has demonstrated that while oral history undoubtedly has its in-
herent challenges as an aggregate source of history, its methodological framework can be
effectively scaled when it is married with other sources, for example, archeology, linguistics,
and texts. Because of his work, the methodologies of gathering oral histories, including
recording, indexing, storing, codifying, and distilling them are now well known and largely
accepted. Certainly, the use of oral history illuminates and interrogates the written colonial
sources on African history which are lopsidedly laden with the perspectives of the agents of
European imperialism in Africa. Like colonial sources with their hegemonic bent, oral his-
tory with all its apparent localisms and revisionisms nonetheless restores African voices to the
history of the continent and provides some epistemological balance in the reconstruction of
African history.
The sources that form the superstructure of this essay, in contrast, are colonial reports
written from the standpoint of colonial policies on abolition and emancipation in the Gold
Coast. Some of them are first-hand account by colonial officials, but others were collected
from African agents and former slaves in the fold of the apprenticeship policy.6 As Henige
has stated,
When colonial rule still prevailed, if barely, attempts to plumb the African past
were typically regarded, at best, as a means to administrative ends and, at worst, as
interesting stories. Missionaries and administrators collected oral data for utilitar-
ian purposes, caring little whether they were true so long as they were serviceable.7
Here, such sources point to the ways that former slaves fared in the Gold Coast within
what colonial officials framed as "apprenticeship," but which turned out to be the feminiza-
tion of post-proclamation unfree labor. Although it is difficult to categorize "freed" slaves in
the primary sources, the evidence broadly refers mostly to young girls ranging in age from
about eleven years to the late teens able to take on some adult tasks in given contexts. The
colonial apprentice policy mandated that all "freed" slaves under colonial apprenticeship be
no more than sixteen years old.' In order to capture some historic moments in some parts
of this essay, I use the nomenclature of the so-called "freed" slaves as it is deployed in the
primary sources. In a broader sense "freed" is a designation for former or liberated slaves, or
simply put, slaves who had obtained their freedoms as a consequence of the colonial aboli-
tion and emancipation policies, but "freed slaves" also refers to persons who had fled in the
pre-abolition period in order to escape their bondage.
The overall paucity of the evidence warrants some additional caveats here. As noted,
the present data on apprenticeship deals specifically with the Cape Coast district of the
Central Province. It should be stressed that there are major gaps in the extant documentary
evidence on the period 1876-1890s and 1900-1924. Colonial abolition policies were more
vigorous in 1874-75, that is, in the immediate aftermath of colonial rule, than at any other
time.9 Indeed, after 1876, very little was done about abolition and emancipation, and for
this reason comprehensive sources on abolition do not exist. Thus the colonial state's efforts

from about 1876 through the end of the century, to abolish slavery and pawnship and to
harness the transition from servile to wage labor, were dismal failures. Effective abolition
of unfree labor occurred only from the 1920s forward when the colonial state assumed
full political control to restructure the pre-capitalist relations of production. In spite of the
paucity of the sources, some aspects of the available evidence are very helpful in illuminating
essential historical processes.
The records are silent on the actual number of former slaves that fell under what may
be described as ad hoc colonial policies of the 1870s and 1880s as well as the more specific
policy, classified as "apprenticeship" in the aftermath of the transformative policy changes
from the early 1890s forward. Exegetical readings of the spate of descriptive and qualita-
tive colonial perspectives on former slaves suggest that the number may be several hundred,
and that the so-called "freed" slave population was certainly larger than the liberated pawn
population. Pawns were different from slaves as they were usually held in or close to their
home regions. It should be stressed that pawns continued to be freed alongside slaves by
the colonial courts throughout the post-proclamation epoch.'0 The difference in popula-
tion size was due to the fact that liberated pawns could trace their debtor-kin groups more
easily. In reality, debtor-kinship groups and pawn-holders tended to belong to the same
lineages. Consequently, unlike former slaves, liberated pawns were more likely to return to
their families than to become the wards of the colonial state. Some pawns who were freed
in the interior and brought down to the coast as the wards of the colonial state eventually
managed to return to their families." As will be explained later, the policy of apprenticeship
was inter-regional, involving the Gold Coast and Northern Nigeria. This made it possible
to place former slave children from the Gold Coast into apprenticeship in Northern Nigeria
and vice versa.
Most of the apprenticed females are simply called Ambah or Amba in the records.
Ambah is a variation of Amma or Ama, an ethnic Akan common name, which means
Saturday-born female. No reason is given in the records to explain why the generic name of
Ambah or Amba was used for so many apprenticed former female slaves. Thus wherever ap-
plicable I have used surnames in addition to the generic name ofAmbah or Amba to identify
individual apprentices.
A Synopsis of the Extant Literature
The British abolition of domestic slavery and pawnship or debt-bondage in the Gold Coast
(colonial Ghana) began in 1874-75 and lasted well into the 1930s. Paradoxically, the British
had overlooked the Asante Kingdom, but stealthily imposed colonial rule on and enacted
abolition in the very states and societies of the Gold Coast that had assisted the British to
defeat Asante in 1873-74.12 Absolutely, the composite subject of colonial rule and aboli-
tion policy in the Gold Coast, the area designated today as the southern region of mod-

ern Ghana, has attracted an avalanche of studies.13 But the actual processes entailed in the
emancipation of slaves and pawns in the Gold Coast, as well as their consequent evolving,
congealing forms of unfree labor, compared to the colonial officials' framing of abolition
policies, are yet to be fifdly assessed.
At least two broad categories of literature may be noted here. The first has looked at
the ways that epochal 1807 abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade transformed interna-
tional commerce, and reconfigured post-abolition servile institutions and the lived experi-
ences of those in the crucible of unfree labor. For example, Sandra Green describes the
institution in the riverine districts of what is today the Volta Region, called trokosi, in which
"families intimidated by the threat of continuous spiritually induced death were forced to
hand over their prepubescent girls to work for and be sexually controlled by the priests."
Trokosi was "specifically influenced by events associated with the 1807 legislative abolition
of the slave trade.'14 Kwabena Adu Boahen has in addition examined the shiffing nature of
gender and servitude in the Central Province of the Gold Coast between 1807 and 1874.
He argues that along the Fante littoral an economic and social transformation expanded
women's slave-holding capacities.'5 The conclusions of this first school concern the defini-
tive effects of abolition in 1807, the seismic changes in the economic and political spheres
which paved the way for the inception of cash crop production in West Africa, euphemisti-
cally called "Legitimate Trade." These scholars demonstrate the ways that the 1807 aboli-
tion impacted gender and social formations in the immediate post-abolition Gold Coast.
The second school of thought looks specifically at the colonial abolition policies that
date from the formative stages of colonial rule in the Gold Coast in 1874-75. It maps out
the colonial state's evanescent role in abolition and emancipation and also rehearses African
responses and initiatives to the intermittent colonial abolition policies. Admittedly this body
of work is very massive in the genealogies of its conclusions, but a look at a few of its in-
terpretive signposts will suffice here. Claire Robertson shows that in the colonial capital of
Accra abolition did not wholly free female slaves from bondage.'6 Beverly Grier, whose work
deals with the Eastern Province of the Gold Coast, argues that abolition increased the use
of female pawn labor in agriculture, especially in the cash-crop production of cocoa.17 While
Grier's work concentrates on agriculture, I have also examined the use of unfree female labor
in porterage services in the post-abolition Central Province.'8 Very recently, I have looked
at abaawa labor and its expansion from the early post-abolition period to the contemporary
era. Abaawa, an Akan word for a young female or a maiden, is a euphemism for exploitative
kinship-based involuntary labor mostly done by prepubescent female house-helps or live-in
domestic servants.'9
From the standpoint of the comparative literature, one major gap in the work on the
Gold Coast is how the colonial government dealt with the problem of former slaves, and to
some extent, liberated pawns adrift in transitioning from bondage to freedom. Certainly, the
freeing of slaves is well-documented in the historiography and needs no further elaboration

here, but the liberation of pawns or of those in debt-bondage is still seldom treated. While
the subject cannot be fully tackled here, it may be stated that once abolition was put in place,
some pawns certainly took matters into their own hands and deserted, while others used the
colonial courts to facilitate their liberation, consequently disregarding whatever outstanding
debts and arrangements had tied them to pawn-holders. Both the primary sources and the
existing literature do not make clear how creditors and debtors responded to the desertions
or the freeing of pawns. It is very likely that debtors unilaterally used the abolition ordi-
nances to cancel their debts to the creditor pawn-holders. In fact, one outcome of abolition
in the Gold Coast regarding debt-bondage, as I have elsewhere argued, is that human pawn-
ing increasingly gave way to the pawning of immovable property, such as land. This was not
only because of the seeming efficacy of abolition laws, but also the realization that migrant
and local wage labor had became cheap enough to superannuate pawn labor.20
From Freedom to Bondage:
Implementation of Apprenticeship Policy
Within the available evidence are some detailed accounts of colonial policies of abolition and
emancipation prior to the introduction of formal apprenticeship policies. The Gold Coast
abolition ordinances of 1874-75 excluded systematic and coherent policies to assist former
slaves and liberated pawns in their transition from bondage to freedom.2' In fact, prior to the
apprenticeship policy enacted in the early 1890s, colonial officials had engaged in uncoordi-
nated activities, which for want of a better word may be described as improvised measures.
For example, some liberated slaves were summarily placed under the care of prison officials,
while some former slaves were handed back to their former holders upon being freed. Still
other liberated slaves, mostly women, were either placed in arranged marriages with colonial
operatives, or lived with District Commissioners as live-in servants.22 These unsystematic
emancipation policies illustrate the persistent undercurrent of the servile institutions in the
post-proclamation period. Indeed, in the throes of the hopelessness, some liberated slaves
returned to their former holders, consequently reverting to forms of dependency and bond-
age.
As a result of the imminent failure of the policy of custodial care in the 1870s and
1880s, the colonial government came up with a new policy of "apprenticeship" to bet-
ter the conditions of former slaves.23 The apprenticeship policy was based on the Colonial
Office's Apprenticeship Act of 1833. Its cardinal principle "was the belief that slaves had to
be 'trained' toward self-discipline and 'responsibility' deemed to be essential for 'free' labor-
ers."T24 In fact, a dispatch sent by the Colonial Office to the colonies as a part of the Abolition
Act sought to "lay the foundation in our colonies of a social system absolved for ever from
the reproach of slavery and which voluntary and effective industry shall take the place of

I OFTEN SHED MY TEARS ABOUT THIS

compulsory labor."25 Also, according to a memorandum issued by the Colonial Office for
the colonies, apprenticeship involved "training for a particular kind of skilled labor which
'combines' education and labor with the promise of eventual self-employment."'26 These ar-
rangements did not better the conditions of former slaves, especially females that were the
most marginalized and vulnerable because of their gender, exploitable reproductive capaci-
ties, foreign origins, and their kinlessness. As a result, such liberated female slaves suffered
the most from the paradoxical colonial policies that liberated slaves, but put them into other
forms of bondage.27
The evidence shows that in apprenticeship policies from the 1890s forward, the colo-
nial state did make efforts to help former slaves in their adjustment to freedom. Specifically
on September 29, 1890, an ordinance was passed by the Gold Coast Legislative Council
to assist former slaves. The ordinance, referring to "apprenticeship" in the official records,
sought to "provide for the Registration and Protection in certain other respects of alien
Children in the Gold Coast Colony."28 The alien children were former slave children who
had not been claimed by their relatives in the aftermath of abolition in 1874-75. It should
be pointed out that the Ordinance did not specifically mention pawns as a part of the pack-
age, but the institution of pawnship all the same fell under the colonial state's efforts to root
out all forms of unfree labor, however defined.
Several events paved the way for the application of the Ordinance of 1890 in the
Gold Coast and its consequent apprenticeship policy of the early twentieth century. First,
in 1888-89, Inspector R-E. Firminger, a former colonial operative in the Gold Coast, then
recuperating in England, reported that there was endemic post-proclamation slavery in the
Gold Coast.29 Second, in 1889-90, Mr. Ed. MacMunn, a former District Commissioner of
Accra, claimed in England that the colonial government and the Gold Coast courts were
lax in administering the abolition laws.30 Third, in the aftermath of these two allegations of
post-proclamation slavery, the London-based Aborigines' Protection Society (APS) vigor-
ously raised the issue of emancipation in the Gold Coast with the Colonial Office. Finally,
the Colonial Office put official pressure on the Gold Coast colonial government to be more
vigilant with abolition and emancipation of slaves.3' It was these concatenated pressures
from different constituencies that compelled the Gold Coast colonial government to for-
mulate an official policy to assist former slaves. The gap in the evidence does not allow us to
fiully reconstruct how the Ordinance of 1890 was administered in the 1890s. However, the
available evidence suggests that during the first three decades of the twentieth century, the
colonial government somewhat implemented the Ordinance of 1890. Thereafter, "appren-
ticeship" in the Gold Coast involved the placement of former slave and pawn children in the
guardianship of colonial officials, prominent African families, and the Christian missions.
In theory, the apprenticeship policy in the Gold Coast sought to equip former slaves
with skilled labor to make them independent in the long term. But as in other British colo
nies, for instance, the Cape Colony and the British Caribbean, where apprenticeship policies

had been implemented earlier, the apprenticeship in the Gold Coast became a means of
exploiting the labor of former slaves.32 For example, Nigel Worden has explained that ap-
prenticeship in the Cape Colony deviated from the objectives set by the Colonial Office in
that it arbitrarily placed children in the guardianship of colonists.33 The same can be said for
the Gold Coast. However, in the aftermath of the First World War, as result of international
anti-slavery pressures, attempts were made to reform the pre-existing apprenticeship policy.
In spite of this, apprenticeship continued to be a source of cheap labor for the elite of the
colonial society.34 Former slaves in apprenticeship in the Gold Coast provided involuntary
labor for their individual upkeep. Unlike in Northern Nigeria, apprentices in the Gold Coast
were not paid for their labor as house servants, farm-hands, carriers or porters, and traders.
In fact, the productive labor of the apprentices benefited the Gold Coast apprentice-hold-
ers.35 In the long-term some apprentices acquired certain skilled labor from whatever work
it was that they performed, for example, masonry and carpentry, but it should be stressed
that the acquisition of such skilled labor by apprenticed former slaves, though theoretically
intended as a colonial policy prescription, was an accidental by-product of the apprentice-
holders' exploitation of apprentices under their tutelage. In other words, apprentice-holders
did not set out to help apprentices to acquire skilled labor that would facilitate their transi-
tion from bondage to freedom.36 Thus apprenticeship in the Gold Coast was a source of
cheap labor for the apprentice-holder and hence fits Alain Morice's view that the usefulness
of apprenticeship "depends largely on the intentions" of the apprentice-holder.37
Former slave children were apprenticed through several methods. One was through
a written application to the colonial administration. The application form included speci-
fications of the number of apprentices that an applicant wanted, gender sought, and how
long an applicant intended to keep a prospective apprentice.38 Upon the acceptance of an
application by the colonial state, an applicant had to make a written undertaking by filling
out and signing the apprenticeship form. Among other things, the form demanded that
an apprentice should "obey [the] lawful commands and not absent herself [sic] by day and
night from the service of an [apprentice-holder]."39 The undertaking also stated that an
apprentice-holder would
provide.., sufficient good meat and drink and lodging, and suitable clothing, and
medical advice and medicine, and will instruct her or cause her to be instructed
in the employment necessary for future life and will cause to be sent regularly to
school until he [sic] is certified to have passed out of Standard IV., and will bring
her to the District Commissioner... on the First Monday in January, April, July and
October in each year.40
Whether these measures, especially the education of the apprenticed children, were ful-
ly carried out remains ambiguous in the sources. The statement of undertaking that informs
the application stipulates that apprentice-holders should equip female apprentices with basic
skills for domesticity and marriage, while male apprentices should be trained for employment

in the public sphere. The second approach, which appears to have been the norm, however
limited in practice, especially from the 1920s, was the colonial policy of apprenticing former
slave children to the Christian missions.4' In a unique case the colonial government granted
sums of money to the Roman Catholic Mission at Cape Coast for the upkeep of an appren-
ticed former slave girl, but it is doubtful whether the colonial state did so for all the liberated
slaves apprenticed to the Christian missions.42 The evidence shows that the Christian mis-
sions had to depend on their own resources, at times woefilly inadequate, to cater to the
needs of apprentices. Notwithstanding a well-documented case that will be discussed below,
the evidence suggests that the colonial policy of apprenticing former slaves to the Christian
missions was selective and ad hoc in nature, or at best evanescent without fruitful results.
The apprenticeship policy stipulated that only children under sixteen years of age were
apprenticeable, and at least in 1908 this age limit was enforced.43 In that year, Mr. H. Bryan,
the Colonial Secretary, directed Mr. E.C. Elliot, the Commissioner of the Central Province,
as follows:
I have the honour to draw your attention to sections 19 and 20 of Ordinance No.
8 of 1893 and to request that as the girl appears to be 16 years you will inform me
under what arrangement she has been apprenticed. How did the girl come to be in
the possession of Superintendent Simmons?44
It is not clear in the records whether the age limit of sixteen years old was rigorously
enforced in the early twentieth century. Even if it was, given the uncertain origins and fa-
milial backgrounds of former slaves it would have been undoubtedly difficult to determine
every exact age. The evidence illustrates that most of former slaves in apprenticeship in the
Gold Coast were females and it is likely that the majority had originated from the Salaga
slave trade.45 Although such former slaves had been given "southern" Akan, Guan, and Ga-
Adangbe names, they were still collectively referred to as "Wangara," an ethno-geographical
designation laden with derogatory connotations synonymous with the "Northern" regional
backwater, specifically, the slave trading axis of Salaga.46 Some of the liberated slaves were
also from the immediate interior or protectorate states.47 For instance, in 1880, Acting
Inspector General, Mr. Cecil Dudley, "captured King Akwasi Baidoo [of Denkyira in the
interior] and the principal offenders" for slave-holding and jailed them in the Elmina castle
prison. Consequently, the "released slaves[,] ... mostly women and young children," were
placed under the care of the "Authorities at Elmina pending the trial" of the king and his
chiefs.48
As noted there is a paucity of evidence regarding the actual number of apprenticed
former slave children. However, one of the recorded lists show that between 1908 and 1913
fourteen liberated slave children were apprenticed to the elite of the colonial society, both
African and European in the Cape Coast District.49 Undoubtedly the true figure may be
higher: among other things, records were not properly kept, especially between 1902 and
1905.50 In 1910, the returns submitted by District Commissioners for some parts of the

Central Province indicate no apprenticeships, and it is possible that the apprenticeship policy
was tapering off.5' Also in 1911, the Acting Commissioner of the Central Province sent
memoranda to District Commissioners reminding them to furnish returns on apprenticed
children in their respective districts to the office of the provincial government. In response,
all the District Commissioners reported that no one had been apprenticed in their respective
districts.52 This suggests that the decline of apprenticeship in the Gold Coast, at least, in the
Cape Coast district, may have coincided with the end of apprenticeship in Northern Nigeria,
which according to C. N. Ubah, occurred between 1907 and 1911.11 The reason given for
the abolition of the policy in Northern Nigeria was that it had become unproductive and
failed as an effective agency of adjustment for former slaves, and the same may be said for the
policy in the Gold Coast.54
Nonetheless the evidence suggests that the apprenticeship policy survived in the Gold
Coast, although it was overshadowed by the demands of the imperial war effort in the Gold
Coast during the First World War from 1914 to 1918, and continued in the 1920s through
some major transformations in policy.55 From about 1920 forward, various Christian mis-
sions, in addition to apprenticing freed slave children to the elite of the colonial society,
assumed significant apprenticeship roles in concert with the colonial state, although their
cooperation with the state was not always harmonious.56 The apprentice-holding role of
the Christian missions was sometimes made difficult by the intervention of colonial officials.
Writing to the Colonial Secretary in 1909, for instance, the Commissioner of the Central
Province explained that the "Mission [the Vicarate of Elmina] is willing to take charge of
the girls provided they are allowed to deal with them in their own way." This included only
an "elementary" education especially in "domestic matters," and marrying them off "when
old enough and with their consent to suitable men."517 For its part, the colonial government
wanted "older" children apprenticed, but the Vicariate of Elmina demurred, on the grounds
that older apprentices were too difficult to retrain in the ways of the church.8 It is likely,
though further research is needed, that the Christian missions did educate some of the ap-
prenticed children in basic literacy, and equipped them with social skils.59 At least one bio-
graphical account subsequently used here as a case study illustrates as much, even though, as
noted, the education of apprenticed former slave girls mainly prepared them for domesticity
and marriage.60 This mirrored the colonial norms in the Gold Coast by the early twentieth
century.6' It is therefore not surprising that marriage was a recurring theme in a substantial
number of official reports on apprenticed females.62
The evidence, inadequate as it may seem, suggests that apprenticed children also suf-
fered abuse at the hands of their apprentice-holders.63 For example, four freed slave children,
one from Gambaga in the Salaga slave trading axis, and the rest from around Lokoja in
Northern Nigeria, apprenticed to the wife of Willouhhy Osborne, the Attorney-General of
the Gold Coast and subsequenty the Chief Justice of Southern Nigeria, were brutally mal-
treated. Although the specific charges are not discussed in the source, the abuse of the four

I OFTEN SHED MY TEARS ABOUT THIS

apprentices became a subject of concern at the Colonial Office in London and was debated
in the British Parliament, and appeared in newspapers, including the Morning Post.64 Nor
did those apprenticed to the Christian missions necessarily fare any better: they too were
exploited as menial servants and put through harsh, regimented daily routines.61
That apprenticed females were sexually exploited may not have been the norm, but it is
not in dispute either.66 In 1908, A. B. Josiah of Cape Coast in the Gold Coast applied for "5
female slave children" from the Freed Slaves' Home in Zungeru. Unfortunately for Josiah,
this occurred just as the "Visiting Committee of the Home" ruled that "no girl wards should
in future be sent out to anyone other than European ladies and religious missions." Similarly
"boy wards" were not to be sent outside the Zungeru region.67 The fact that the authorities
streamlined the policy confirms the abuse experienced by apprentices, especially females, at
the hands of apprentice-holders. Additionally, on June 21, 1909, the District Commissioner
of Saltpond wrote to the Acting Commissioner of the Central Province that:
I have the honor to inform you that I was at Mankessim on the 7th instant when
I visited Mr. Taylor at his house and saw the 3 slave children (sic) at present with
him... Ambah, a girl of 16 years...has a child about 2 weeks old; Mr. Taylor is the
father of this child.68
Mr. Taylor's sexual exploitation of this Ambah, apprenticed to him by the colonial
state, may fairly stand for what other apprentice-holders did to liberated female slaves un-
der their tutelage. The available evidence does not allow us-to quantify the number of ap-
prentice-holders who were sexually exploited, but the comparative evidence suggests that a
sizeable number of apprentice-holders forthrightly cohabited with apprentices. It may have
been a common problem.69 In practice, the colonial authorities turned a blind eye to it, and
in this case the District Commissioner of Saltpond claimed that "Ambah" was "quite happy
and well treated," and neither the District Commissioner nor the acting commissioner com-
plained that Mr. Taylor had cohabited with her.7° Rather, the Acting Commissioner, having
imputed too much freedoms and choices to apprenticed liberated female slaves, just as other
officials may have done, assured the District Commissioner:
As long as you are sure that these girls and boy quite understand that they are at
liberty to go away anytime they wish and that Taylor cannot call on them for any
money or return anything he may have given them I think the matter may rest as
it is.7'
In fact, the evidence adduced here supports Ubah's position that apprentices were
abused and sexually exploited by apprentice-holders, which may have been well known to
the colonial authorities in the Gold Coast.
Apprenticed liberated slaves sometimes took matters into their own hands. Some fled
from their apprentice-holders or eloped with their lovers. For example, an apprenticed girl,
Ambah Satura, apprenticed to Pet. AW. [sic] Renner of Awoonor Chambers, Cape Coast,
eloped to Kumasi with Ginadu Wangara, a police sergeant. The efforts of Mr. Renner, the

157

KWABENA O. AKURANG-PARRY

apprentice-holder, to reclaim Ambah Satura failed because the Chief Commissioner of
Asante (adjacent to the Gold Coast) would not, for an unknown reason, permit her to re-
turn or to be brought back.72 By 1909, Ambah Satura had moved with Sergeant Wangara
to Sekondi, his new station, in the Western Province of the Gold Coast. In the long run,
Mr. Renner decided, it was not worth having her back, and the Acting Commissioner of the
Central Province conjectured that if "she is satisfied with her present position I would sug-
gest she might be allowed to remain."'73 The case illustrates how apprentices embarked on
ventures, however misguided, in order to safeguard their autonomy.
Overall, poor record-keeping contributed to the ineffectiveness of the apprenticeship
policy: it allowed apprenticed children to fall through the cracks of the colonial apprentice-
ship bureaucracy. For example, in 1908, as a result of the aforementioned abuse of the four
liberated slaves in apprenticeship in the Gold Coast, the office of the Undersecretary of
State for Colonies in London sought information on them from the Gold Coast officials.
Unfortunately, the Gold Coast government could not trace their records at the District
Commissioner's office in Elmina where presumably their apprenticeship had been processed,
and a search of the "Office of Alien Children" did not yield any information on them ei-
ther.74 Mr. E.C. Eliot, the Commissioner of the Central Province, acknowledged that "these
records were not kept up during the years 1902 to 1905."'T This suggests that a consider-
able number of apprenticed children were forgotten by the colonial state and had to depend
on the generosity or otherwise of the apprentice-holders for their transition from bondage
to freedom. It is very likely that in most cases apprentices experienced neglect, exploitation,
and abuse.
The period of seemingly rough-and-ready colonial policies appears to have ended by
1908. At that point the colonial government adopted a more vigilant stance toward appren-
ticeship and its record-keeping.76 There is no evidence in the primary sources or the extant
literature that explains the timing and the apparent change in policy. The colonial govern-
ment began to seek new apprentice-holders for apprentices whose former apprentice-holders
had died or fallen into dire circumstance.77 The colonial government also concerned itself
with the problems of apprenticeship beyond the Gold Coast, in Asante as well. When Ambah
Satura eloped, for instance, the Acting Provincial Commissioner of the Central Province
communicated with the Assistant Commissioner of Police for Asante and the Commissioner
of the Western Provinceto effect her return.78 Additionally, letters were sent to remind ap-
prentice-holders of their obligation under the apprentice policy to report annually to the
colonial authorities, which policy apparently enabled the colonial authorities to ascertain the
welfare of apprenticed freed slaves.79 Also, the colonial government kept a watchful eye on
Northern Nigerian freed slave children who had been apprenticed to inhabitants of the Gold
Coast. For example, Mrs. Maria Hutchinson had to report to the District Commissioner of
Accra with two freed slave girls she had acquired from the Zungeru Freed Slaves Home in
Northern Nigeria.8° Whether this vigilance changed the fortunes of the former slave children

in apprenticeship is difficult to determine. The evidence, however, suggests that these radical
changes in policy were evanescent and were derailed by the exigencies of the First World War
in the Gold Coast.
Inter-Regional Apprenticeship:
The Gold Coast and Northern Nigeria
C. N. Ubah, in his study of the Freed Slaves Home in Northern Nigeria, highlights the
fact that apprentice-holders were sought in the Gold Coast to apprentice liberated slaves
residing in the Zungeru Freed Slaves Home in Northern Nigeria.8 Thus colonial officials
in Northern Nigeria and in the Gold Coast cooperated regarding the apprenticeship of for-
mer slaves.82 The beneficiaries of this inter-regional apprenticeship policy were African and
European traders, merchants, teachers, missionaries, and other professional elites. Although
freed slave children were officially apprenticed to men, in reality they were kept under the
tutelage of wives, consorts, or female relatives of the male elites of the colonial society.8
Although, official policy sought to limit the relocation of apprentices as the 1908 case
of Josiah shows, in 1910 and 1911, apprenticed children were still being sent to the Gold
Coast under the administrative auspices of the Northern Nigerian colonial government.
For example, and as noted, in 1910, Mrs Maria Hutchinson of the Gold Coast, "a mother
of a senior clerk in the service of this Protectorate [of Northern Nigeria]," was allowed to
take two freed slave girls from the Freed Slave Home in Zungeru to the Gold Coast. Mrs.
Hutchinson was informed that "she will be liable for the cost of the repatriation of these
children, should at any time the necessity to repatriate them arise."'84 Also, in March 1911,
Mr. H.S. Goldsmith, the Acting Chief Secretary of the Government in Zungeru, informed
the Colonial Secretary of the Gold Coast of the following:
Mr. J.B. Sagoe, Leatherworker, Northern Nigeria Regiment, in the Service of this
Protectorate, Native of Cape Coast has been granted permission by the Acting
Governor to take with him to Cape Coast an Apprenticed Freed Slave Boy and His
Excellency will feel obliged if you will kindly take such steps as you consider neces-
sary to see that the boy is not illtreated or disposed of.8
Certainly, the official information above shows that official policies sought to protect the
welfare of apprentices, but whether colonial officials and apprentice-holders carried out such
policies is not clear from the available evidence.
Although Ubah reveals that former slave children from Northern Nigeria were ap-
prenticed in the Gold Coast, he does not show that liberated slave children from the Gold
Coast were taken to Northern Nigeria. In fact, apprenticed former slave children were al-
lowed to accompany their apprentice-holders to and from both colonies. For instance, in
1909, the District Commissioner of Cape Coast sought information "from the Mothers
Superior at Cape Coast and Elmina Roman Catholic Convents" about four freed slave girls

from the Gold Coast who had been apprenticed to the wife of the Chief Justice Osborne of
Southern Nigeria.86 Also in 1910, Mr. J. Andoh, "a clerk in Northern Nigeria and a native of
Elmina" in the Central Province of the Gold Coast, took with him a freed slave boy from the
Gold Coast to Northern Nigeria.87 With regard to the case of 1909 above, the names of the
freed slave girls were Mary, who originated from Gambaga in the Northern Territories, later
a part of the Gold Coast, while the rest, namely Graney, Garthe, and Gambia, were initially
brought to the Gold Coast from the Lokoja area of Northern Nigeria.88 The given names
of these apprentices show how apprentice-holders renamed apprentices and so suggest the
high degree of paternalism exercised over former slave children. Furthermore, the ambigu-
ity that informs the origin of these freed slave children is a testimony to the indiscriminate
manner with which liberated slave children were moved about between the Gold Coast and
the Northern Nigeria.
The Gold Coast government showed keen interest in the departure of such former
slave children to Northern Nigeria. The apprentice-holder and his/her apprentices were
required to report to the colonial authorities on the day before departure so that colonial
officials could ascertain the state of health and well-being of the accompanying apprentice.89
In spite of the official instructions, the records do not explain how freed slave children in the
inter-regional apprenticeship were treated or fared in the long-term. Direct evidence does
not tell us about the adjustments made by liberated slave children placed in inter-regional
apprenticeships, but extrapolating from the wider evidence and the comparative literature
suggests that apprenticed children became sources of menial labor for the elite of the colo-
nial society.
A Case Study of Apprenticeship:
Amba Ata alias Grace Orleans, 1924-ca.1930
There is a major gap in the records from April 7, 1913, to February 29, 1924. Fortunately,
spanning 1924 to 1928 is a composite apprenticeship biography of Amba Ata also known
as Grace Orleans.90 The evidence on this former slave girl throws additional fight on some
of the questions raised and conclusions drawn above, fills some gaps, and points to further
areas of research. Amba Ata first emerges in the official accounts on June 29, 1924: the Gold
Coast Governor, F. G. Guggisberg, writing to Mr. Justice R. E. Hall of the colonial courts,
noted that he had "approved of the grant of an annual allowance of£l 5 for the maintenance
of this girl [Amba Ata] to the Roman Catholic Mission at Cape Coast until such a time,
she may be restored to her family."9' While the biography of Amba Ata provides multiple
perspectives on the colonial policy of apprenticeship and the responses of apprentices, there
are several ambiguous strands of information. First, it is not clear what is meant by being
"restored to her family." It is likely that if she had an accessible natal "family" the colonial

government would not have apprenticed her to the Roman Catholic Church. She may have
been liberated by the colonial state from another family and apprenticed to the Orleans
family, whose surname she bore; the Orleans family belonged to the kinship group of Chief
Coker of Cape Coast, and was very powerful and influential.92 If so, however, it is unclear
why the colonial government paid for her upkeep with the Roman Catholic Mission at
Cape Coast. At any rate the available evidence shows that Amba Ata was associated with the
Orleans family as an apprentice and like most apprentices was given the apprentice-holders'
family name. This did not indicate outright assimilation into the host kinship network of the
Orleans. At best, it was a form of familial association that recognized Amba Ata as an inferior
dependant.
Second, Amba Ata "was placed by the order of the Court" into apprenticeship,93 sug-
gesting that her apprentice-holders, very likely the Orleans family, had been subjected to
some form of prosecutorial demands, leading to their loss of Amba Ata to the colonial state.
Yet Amba Ata referred to the Orleans as her "parents" in a letter she wrote to the colonial
authorities, stating that she wanted to opt out of the Roman Catholic Convent so that she
could return to them.94 While the evidence does not explain the circumstances entailed in
the court case or the judgement of the court, when she ran away from the Roman Catholic
Convent, she again sought refuge in the Orleans family home.95 Amba Ata's reference to
the Orleans as her parents and the fact that she sought security in their home suggest that
apprentices could develop apparently strong attachments to their apprentice-holders. For
her part Madam Mansah Orleans, the matriarch of the Orleans family, sought through the
District Commissioner's court to retain Amba Ata. The evidence shows that if Amba Ata
had had her way, she would have chosen the Orleans as her family. This may be due to the
prestige attached to the Orleans family, or simply that she came to the conclusion that her
association with them was her best choice.
Finally, the annual allowance of£15 granted by the colonial government in 1924 for
the upkeep of Amba Ata was unusual. In the pre-war period the colonial government ap-
parently did not give any allowance to the Christian Missions.96 This changed in the post-
war period when the office of the Gold Coast governor became particularly interested in
seeing to the success of policy. In fact, in 1925, the District Commissioner of Cape Coast
requested a subvention of £15 because the amount "allocated for the year 1924 [was] ex-
hausted on the 31st December," and his request was granted.97 Subsequently, the amount
of £15 was granted annually by the colonial government in 1926, 1927, and 1928 to the
Roman Catholic Convent for the upkeep of Amba Ata.98 Amba Ata's case may have been
quite unusual, as the governor himself was directly involved; ordinarily a junior colonial op-
erative would have written the letter of approval for earmarking money for an apprentice's
upkeep. In the 1920s the Colonial Office, through the instrumentality of the International
Labor Organization (ILO) and League of Nations, put enormous pressure on the colonial
government to abolish all forms of unfree labor, which resulted in addressing problems

facing former slaves.99 Governor Guggisberg's direct involvement in Amba Ata's case may
have exemplified the vigorous shift in colonial policy with regard to unfree labor and toward
confronting the problems facing liberated slaves.
In the end, Amba Ata sought to opt out of the Roman Catholic Convent and the letter
she submitted to colonial government is worth quoting at length:
Dear Sire,
I am very sorry to write to you today that, I have now grown up a big girl, so I beg
you to allow me to come home. Because I am tired of the Convent. I have also told
Rev. Mother to allow me to come home, but in vain. So I am asking you to let me
come home. For I am longing to see my parents. I will be very glad if you try to do
so. Dear Sire, I often shed my tears about this. So try your possible best and judge
my case for I am a poor girl Grace Orleans.00
Amba Ata's letter above raises several questions. First, a textual analysis of the gram-
mar, syntax, style, and the first-person narrative content of the letter suggest that she may
have written it by herself. This supports the contention that some of the liberated slave chil-
dren, apprenticed to the Christian missions, had received a rudimentary education. Second,
the fact that she wanted to break her association with the Convent illustrates the harshness
and failure of the apprenticeship policy. Third, the recurring invocation of "home" reiterates
the irony that the host-kinship family was often the only place to which former slave children
could return, irrespective of previous abuse and exploitation. Finally, in spite of the problems
ranged against her, Amba Ata made decisions and choices to bolster her independence, and
such quests for autonomy may well have been common among former slaves who struggled
to break away from the constraints of the apprenticeship policy.
After Amba Ata's letter the District Commissioner of Cape Coast asked Mr. Andrew
Jones, the Commissioner of the Central Province, if he could "tell me... if the girl has any
parents to whom she can go."'' In the end, Mr. Jones instructed that she should be sent
back to the convent, and Madam Mansah Orleans complied on May 1, 1928.02 But Amba
Ata, bent on her own choices in freedom, made good her escape from the convent: three days
later, Sister Mariah, the Acting Superintendent of the Our Lady of the Apostles Convent,
wrote to Mr. Jones, stating that Amba Ata "has not as yet returned to the Convent."'03
Eventually, the Supreme Court instructed the "Police Commissioner [of Cape Coast]... to
cause the girl to be searched for and sent back to the Convent at Elmina.''04 The remaining
evidence shows that Amba Ata was not captured by the authorities. In the end Amba Ata's
case, while undoubtedly unique, points to the vigilance adopted by the colonial government
in the post-First World War period, and illustrates former slaves' struggles for autonomy and
freedoms.

Conclusion
The gendering of abolition literature has provided insights into how abolition shaped not
only the fortunes of former slaves and pawns, but also how abolition and emancipation
reconfigured forms of unfree labor, in this case "apprenticeship," in the post-proclamation
Gold Coast. At the inception of colonial rule in 1874, no systematic effort was made to assist
former slaves. It was not until about the early 1890s that the Gold Coast Legislative Council
enacted an ordinance to assist former slave children in the form of "apprenticeship," indeed,
as a means to facilitate liberated slaves' transition from bondage to freedom. Overall, the
policy of apprenticeship remained woefully inadequate, and was fitfiully applied. Although,
in 1908, colonial officials adopted a vigilant stance toward the problems of apprenticeship,
the evidence illustrates that the transition in policy did not benefit the majority of former
slave children. Rather liberated slave children became a source of cheap labor, and in some
cases, objects of sexual gratification for the elite of the colonial society. The case of Amba
Ata, alias Grace Orleans, amply demonstrates the ambiguity of the policy: she seemed to
have acquired some education that could have been an engine of social mobility, but the lack
of autonomy that buttressed the apprenticeship system derailed her chances for a fulil adjust-
ment to freedom. In all, Amba Ata's complicated biography underscores the deficiencies
in the apprenticeship policy which inevitably compelled liberated slaves to depend on the
very apprentice-holders who oppressed and exploited them. It is likely that liberated slaves
who sought adjustments on their own fared no better, because the choices available to them
could not secure their complete autonomy.

and travelogue accounts of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century. In the main they
identify pawnship as a consequence of problems and crises within the kinship system that forced
kin groups to pawn their members as human collateral for debt; many emphasize the supposed
benignity of the institution of pawnship. See Brodie Cruickshank, Eighteen Years on the Gold Coast

HISTORICAL TRADITION AND THE SITUATIONAL DEPLOYMENT OF STORY

Historical Tradition and the
Situational Deployment of Story
MUSTAFA KEMAL MIRZELER, DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH,
WESTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY
n the second floor of Memorial Library at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
thereis adimlylitcorner, atthe edge ofiwon bookshelves, next to Dr. DavidHenige's
book-filled, neatly kept office. Across from Dr. Henige's office is a yellowish long
wooden table. There I used to read for hours upon hours the fascinating African
stories from Harold Scheub's collections and Jan Vansina's Oral Tradition as History as I pre-
pared for my African Mythology course. I also read John Lamphear's Traditional History ofthe
Jie of Uganda and became fascinated with Jie historical tradition, a fascination that ultimately
led to my travel to Najie in northern Uganda to become an apprentice to Jie storytellers living
in the vast sprawling Karamoja Plateu and in the desert plains of Turkana in northern Kenya.
I would often engage in conversations with David Henige about African oral tradition,
as he went in and out of his office. These conversations centered on oral tradition, history,
memory, and myth, and the implicit relationships and connections among them. My discus-
sions with Henige, my reading of Scheub's analysis of African stories, Vansina's works on
oral tradition, Lamphear's book on Jie oral tradition, and my apprenticeship to African sto-
rytellers in northern Uganda and Kenya among the Jie and Turkana people, helped me be-
gin to fathom the historicity of Jie stories, and to see them as memories informing people's
historical consciousness.
Specifically, I learned from Henige, Scheub, and the African storytellers that the pur-
pose of performing historical tradition is not to reconstruct the past, but to locate and reflect
on that past in a present context. Henige, like Scheub and Vansina, was interested not only
in the narration of the past, but also in the production of the past during performances,
when reciprocal relationships influence the experiences of both the performer and his audi-
ence. Echoing the power of doubt, in his usual and unique way, Henige often questioned
the objectivity of history, pointing out the inexorable effects of the political and emotional

significance of remembering in representing the past. Henige's reaction took a variety of
forms in his response to my questions about the interrelationships between memory and
history, understandably so, given the complicated and multifaceted nature of these topics. In
discussing my fieldwork experiences with Henige, my quest to link tradition and memory,
coupled with my extensive reading and discussions of Scheub's and Vansina's theorizing of
oral tradition, played an important role in understanding the relationship between past and
present in performance processes, as Jie storytellers play the role of historians.
The second set of influences derives from Najie in the Karamoja Plateau in northern
Uganda and in the Turkana land of northern Kenya. There I became an apprentice to story-
tellers and participated in the performances of historical tradition in various social contexts.
There I played the tape-recorded stories that I had collected in Najie and in various parts of
Turkana land, listening to them with the Jie and Turkana storytellers who had performed
them. When I returned to Madison, I shared with Henige, Vansina and Scheub what the
jie and Turkana storytellers had told me. While the storytellers in the field said their per-
formances were about real events, Henige and others insisted that they were narratives of
people's memories about their past experiences told in the context of the present. Here I
discuss the notion of oral historical tradition as a narrative kept in memory among the Jie
people of northern Uganda and northern Kenya. The topic of memory and history is an apt
contribution to a book written in honor of Henige.
This paper focuses on the contextual use of "memory images" in historical traditions
in Jimos village in Najie and in the kraals around Koteen Hill in the Karamoja Plateau and
Tarash River in northern Kenya. The analysis of the historical tradition within the social and
political context provides an opportunity to examine how present social relations are inter-
locked with the significant local memories in historical traditions. This interlocking provides
unique pathways for the local construction of identities and personal relationships both in
the Jimos village and in the kraals in the region. Memory images contained in the Jie histori-
cal tradition vary according to current social and political circumstances, among other fac-
tors. They are shaped by local kinship politics, subsistence activities and by various other pat-
terns of cultural and political ecology, which provide them with discourses to construct their
world and engage in social relationships. In Jie culture, historical traditions form an integral
part of the local discourse, and figuratively connect the conceptual realms of the local people
with their day-to-day empirical existence. The memory images of jie historical tradition are
often "interlocked" with various other local traditions linking salient social interactions and
providing the discursive plot for local social dramas.'
The jie speak a Nilotic language. In 1995, they numbered about 50,000, most of
whom lived within the borders of Najie, which has an area of approximately 1,300 square
miles. Najie is a dry and warm high plateau zone with an altitude of more than 3,500 feet.
As an ecological zone, Najie has recognizable, thin wild vegetation, and dry climate. The lie
cultivate many crops which are adapted to the dry environment. Medicinal plants, tobacco,

and maize, are all interspersed in the edges of sprawling sorghum fields, but sorghum is the
most important crop in the Jie's diet and economy. Varieties of sorghum grow well in the
cotton soil of Najie. There are also numerous varieties of wild fruits, bushes, and clumps of
thorny thickets, all important to the economy of the Jie.
There is a major territorial division in Najie. The larger block is in the south, called
Lokorwokol (place of Orwakol), and the smaller one in the north is Lokolodiny (place of
Lodiny). An east-west axis therefore divides the whole of Najie into two parts named after
the earliest politico-religious leaders of the Jie, Orwakol and Lodiny. The Lokarwokol ter-
ritorial division, which is the focus of this paper, is subdivided into seven territorial sections
namely, Losilang, Kotyang, Kanawat, Kotido, Komukunyu, Panyangara, and Nakapelimoru,
deriving their names from the seven wives of Orwakol. All of the subdivisions of Lokorwakol
are strung out along the banks of the Longiro River, except Nakapelimoru, which is located
in the southeastern part of the Karamoja Plateau. About thirty miles east of Nakapelimoru is
the Koten Hill region, where the Turkana cattle are allowed to graze near the eastern edges
of the Karamoja Plateau.
The oral traditions I have studied among the Jie are called eemut (plural: ngiemuto),
"story-history." The past depicted in an eemut usually contains an occasion-bound plot
encapsulating what Vansina calls "remembrance-images" or here, memory images.2 The
historical tradition is thrilling to watch when performed, as it is a spontaneously composed
prose narrative, delivered before an audience. A performance of historical tradition, inher-
ently dramatic and artistic, does not simply narrate certain past events but reflects on those
past events. The discourse of historical tradition is one of the means by which Jie people
rationalize the social and political realities of their contemporary world.
The plot of historical tradition unfolds against the ancient geography of Najie, the-
matically encoding Jie ancestral values associated with the human ideals and moral virtues
of living in a dry environment. The Jie people love their land and believe that they inherited
the land they inhabit from their ancestors, and that these ancestors set the society's rules and
customs, and define rights and access to resources. Thus, their perception of the contempo-
rary world has at its base the memory of the moral authority of the ancestors who sanctified
their land and enforced interdependent relationships in which (for the most part) male elders
control various resources and provide for the women and young men and children. Because
of the moral superiority of their ancestors, Jie people generally live their lives as defined by
their ancestors. In Jie ideology, the primary source of this ancestral moral superiority is as-
sociated with the uncertainty of life in a dry environment, as well as the uncertain political
relations recorded by historical tradition. Various institutions, rituals, and countless perfor-
mances in the historical tradition (which are believed to be true stories) reflect the moral
superiority of the lie ancestors. The central concept is the need for survival in an unpredict-
able dry environment, necessitating a respect for individual ights to resources and moral
obligations for people to share pasture, water, and food vital to individual survival.

MUSTAFA KEMAL MIRZELER

The dry environment produces conditions that encourage sharing resources between
people because sharing of scarce resources is practically important for survival. The memory
images of historical traditions provocatively and poetically trigger the meaning of the histori-
cal traditions, fully expressed in the tradition of sharing and offering of food and water. The
meaning of the memory of ancestral experiences of sharing resources for survival is discursive
and it is "institutionalized," referring to the ancestral memories that created the complex in-
teraction of practices among people and between communities.' The storytellers constantly
modify the memory images of ancestral events, in order to construct a "pastness" as a lived
experience.4 The memory images provide people with knowledge as to how their ancestors
lived and how people in the contemporary world should live.
The interlocking engagement between memory images and historical tradition, as
represented in the local transactional strategies between people and communities, is the
central puzzle. The Jie memory images of past famines and survival distinctively feature in
the historical experience and the political thought of the mixed-farming and transhumant
Jie, which are clearly linked to the historical tradition. The placing of the "implicit meaning"
within the historical tradition5 enables one to examine the linkages between memory and
historical tradition, which create a powerful space for people to experience the past ancestral
discourses in the present performances of historical traditions. Analyzing jie historical tradi-
tions as performance requires some knowledge of basic concepts in folklore and anthropol-
ogy. The writings of Harold Scheub provide background on the concepts of oral tradition
as performance, cultural memory, and folkloric motif; Karen Barber illuminates the concept
of oral tradition as a dialogical representation of ideology; and Michael Meeker provides
context for the concept of oral tradition as political discourse.6
Historical Tradition as Performance Art Defined: Harold
Scheub's Concept of Memory and Oral Tradition
Harold Scheub's original and highly provocative conceptualization of oral tradition was and
is fueled by his apprenticeship to Xhosa and Ndebele storytellers in a way useful for my study
of Jie historical tradition as performance. Scheub defines Xhosa oral tradition, as "cultural
memory and folkloric motif."7 He teases out the roles of the storyteller as artist and creator,
a manipulator of memory, working with empirical reality and fictions both. Storytellers,
according to Scheub, nurture and perpetuate the collectively remembered memory images
within the context of contemporary human experience. They organize and give meaning
and form to these collective memories as a philosophical statement and as "historical obser-
vation" in performances. He maintains that the performance of oral tradition is a confluence
of ancient images with those of the contemporary world, the routine of everyday experience
and rituals: the world of the storytellers and their audiences.8

HISTORICAL TRADITION AND THE SITUATIONAL DEPLOYMENT OF STORY

For Scheub, it is the storytellers who juxtapose the inherited memory images with con-
temporary images and artfiflly bring the members of the audience into an emotional union
with their past. Through the work of their art, the storytellers unify varying disparate images
of the past in such a way that enables the members of the audience to have contact with the
cultural memory condensed in their imaginative tradition. Performance is a crucial device in
the transmission of ancient images which enables the members of the audience to experience
past in present.
Scheub's conceptualization of oral tradition in terms of performance is useful for my
work for two reasons. First, he situates the oral tradition within a "relevant context," to use
Bauman's formulation, in which settings and "cultural scenes" serve as the most important
organizing principle of memory images.9 In Jie society there are certain cultural scenes, such
as peace talks, sacrifices, and various rituals, which require performance. In addition to such
formal cultural settings, performances of oral tradition might occur spontaneously while
people rest under the trees, work in the field or with penned cattle. There are also cultural
scenes for which performance is not necessarily expected, yet may occur. During these per-
formances, the storytellers usually set the "interpretive frame" as they distil the collectively
remembered memory images within a contemporary context.10
Second, Scheub's exploration of the interrelationship between memory and perfor-
mance is crucial for my understanding of the ways the storytellers organize the semiotic
richness of memory images and evoke emotion, through which people come to terms with
past and present life events. My experiences as an apprentice to storytellers in sub-Saharan
East Africa have shown me the subtle manipulation of memory and emotion by storytellers.
Through their poetic body language and their words, the storytellers persuade the members
of the audience to identify themselves with their heroes, their icons and their traditions.
Identification occurs in performances when the storytellers persuade the members to con-
nect with the past, thereby effecting a convergence of the contemporary world with the
mythic world of the ancestors at various points.
Historical Tradition as Dialogical Representation of
Ideology: Karin Barber's I Could Speak Until Tomorrow
In her treatment of oral tradition, Karin Barber studies the representation of ideology, so-
ciety's conception of itself, and personhood - salient and enduring themes in the fields
of folklore and anthropology. Barber's study of oriki (historical tradition) as performance
and art explores how oriki is created through various commentaries and utterances that
enter into oriki genres during their performance. Barber describes how they become en-
tangled with public discourse on various genealogies and kin groups who, by virtue of their
dominant political position, embody society's ideology and sense of identity. The diverse

cultural memories found in oriki, according to Barber, are not historical tales in the way we
understand history in the western world, but rather they are deeply grounded fragments
of memory images through which communities express their heartfelt convictions about
themselves, to themselves.
The performances of oriki "open windows" to the past and enable the members of the
audience to peek through these windows as they reimagine their contemporary situations in
light of past events. The performances are ways of "experiencing the past by bringing it back
to life."1  Barber's general thesis is that the raw materials of historical traditions are created
and valorized in performance contexts, as new contexts enter into the text in the form of as-
semblies of diverse voices. These voices engender memories that are compressed and packed
with hidden meanings that codify "past-derived observations" and explanations in light of
the present.12 Oriki, as a major feature of Okuku cultural memory, references not only past
events, but also current social and political moments, so that in the process of remembering
and inscribing during a performance, the storyteller and audience may imagine present rela-
tions. Oriki performances are deeply embedded social practices which inform present actions
in the society. "Oriki," Barber says, "are essentially historical in the sense that they are one
of the ways in which the relations of the present with the past" are constructed.'3 Through
them the Okuku community comes to terms with itself in fight of the past.
This way of looking at historical traditions accords with my understanding of the Jie
historical tradition and its performances. The memory images of the Jie historical tradition
stem, in part, from storytellers' poetic representations and valorization of political ideology
in multiple contexts and performance situations. These performances constitute the "dia-
logical imagination" of the past, those highly entangled fragments of memory images that
capture whatever may be "worth remembering.'4
Unlike oriki, which speaks disconnected utterances and memory fragments, the Jie
historical tradition is composed of coherent memory images in complete prose narratives,
which refer to diverse incidents and circumstances concerning the Jie ancestral family.
Performances of the historical tradition serve as medium for the poetics of remembering the
past both in Scheub's and Barber's senses. Such poetic recalling of past memories are essen-
tially political investments which restore the authorial voices of the ancestors. An examina-
tion of how and why the past is remembered poetically reveals the strategies and ideologies
that enable the actors to survive in a dry environment and to share scarce resources.
Therefore the Jie historical tradition as remembered memory images engages poetic
discourses of vulnerability created by the dry environment. My argument is that we cannot
understand the fundamentally central role of the historical tradition in Jie people's collec-
tive memory without understanding its profound relationship to the project of survival in
an unpredictable environment. As I will show, thematic images in the historical tradition
are grounded in the conception of vulnerability. This vulnerability, created by uncertainty
in political relations and the unpredictability of the physical environment, throws into relief

HISTORICAL TRADITION AND THE SITUATIONAL DEPLOYMENT OF STORY

the moral responsibilities and glorious deeds of ancestors who experienced similar political
and environmental uncertainties, and yet they responded to crises and maintained moral
responsibility.
The performance event enables the storytellers and the members of the audience to
remember the meaning of the ancestral past and to reimagine key events relevant to the
present circumstances.'5 Therefore the images of the historical tradition arise out of myriad
performance contexts and social climates that shape over and over the remembered memory
images of the past and its meaning. The memory images of the Jie historical tradition are
beautiful and multi-vocal with their "semantic-open-endedness"'6 (Bakhtin's term, relayed
by Barber); they evolve dialogically with contemporary contexts through performance.
Michael Meeker: Poetic Discourses of Vulnerability
and Social Responsibility for Survival
Michael Meeker analyzes the interrelation between the poetics of historical traditions and
political violence among the camel raiding Bedouins in North Arabia. Relying on Alois
Musil's rich corpus of the oral texts and ethnographic descriptions of the Rwala Bedouins,
Meeker uses language that is congruent to the experiences of the Jie people and their his-
torical tradition. According to Meeker's analysis, Rwala Bedouin nomads, who live in a dry
and unpredictable environment, are forced to maintain the integrity of their "vulnerable
domestic wealth" in order to survive. To overcome conflict and to ensure survival in an un-
certain environment and unpredictable situations, the actors are forced to form independent
herding groups across the desert and establish political alliances in order to defend against
the patterns of social and political instabilities that threaten their herding groups. However,
sometimes the political community and authority are not effective in resolving conflict and
protecting human lives. To overcome this, the Rwala Bedouins developed a distinct politi-
cal institution which Meeker refers to as "the ceremonial narratives." Performance of these
narratives entails retelling stories of actual wars and raids which have occurred mostly within
living memory. The act of composing a ceremonial narrative is also the act of constructing a
personal identity; during this process, the storytellers harness sometimes disturbing memo-
ries laden with emotions familiar to the members of the audience.7
The construction of personal identity has an interesting correlate in the ceremonial
narrative. The content of the ceremonial narrative is patterned and expresses certain themes
such as "the relationship of men and personal instruments of aggression," which, Meeker
writes, is a "central feature of North Arabian Bedouin political experience."'8 Meeker ob-
serves that ceremonial narratives are persuasive and that they assume a way of life for no-
madic pastoralism that demands routine political strategies. '9 The storytellers, in develop-
ing interpretations of the ceremonial narratives, attempt to explore strategic possibilities for

dealing actively with contemporary political experience and conflict situations. They per-
suasively appeal to memories of past events and urge their audiences to consider what kinds
of behavior might be the basis for standard human interaction for those who live in hostile
environments and face political uncertainties, yet who must protect and support human life.
Ceremonial narratives are expressed via certain artistic and poetic conventions that in-
voke the moral authority of "political investment" to protect and support human life against
various crises, whether social, political, or natural. The very process of telling the ceremonial
narratives provides a window on historical processes according to Meeker, revealing "some
indication of the way in which popular motivations took shape within a pattern of circum-
stances" and thus of "the general character of a people's historical experience.'"20
The forms of artistic expression observed by Meeker in the ceremonial narratives
among the Bedouin are also intrinsic to the performances of the Jie historical tradition. jie,
like Bedouin people, live in a dry environment, cope with similar political uncertainties,
and deal with the problem of protecting the integrity of "vulnerable domestic wealth" and
resources. Here, Meeker's analysis of the Bedouin ceremonial narratives sheds light on the
Jie storytellers' poetic reflections on the historical tradition and their invocation of ancestral
moral authority. The jie historical tradition, like ceremonial narratives, is a form of persuasive
expression; performances are a response to Jie political and historical experiences, expressed
in certain fixed forms and involving fixed themes. Moreover, they provide a glimpse not only
at the political and historical experiences of the ancestors, but also at patterns of political
motivations and events important to Jie people.
The jie storytellers, like their Bedouin counterparts, are intimately familiar with their
society and unfolding political events, hence they often appeal (strategically and poetically)
for peace to counter the aggression that threatens their existence. Among the Jie, the artistic
expression of the peoples' vulnerable and interdependent selves is profoundly bound up with
the process of performance of the historical tradition; this, in turn, is bound up with political
interests. Indeed, the concept of the vulnerable individual is entwined with political interests
and the concerns and interdependences of communities and individuals. The themes of in-
terdependence are invoked as proper moral standards for everyday life and they are involved
in conflict mediations between communities and individuals.
The forms of lie and Turkana historical tradition generally consist of a prose narrative,
if written down equivalent to between a paragraph and a few pages in length, created spon-
taneously before an audience. The stuff of Jie historical tradition is "at once cultural memory
and folkloric motif" in Scheub's sense, and it is fascinating to witness the storytellers artfully
fusing contemporary images with the "the repertory of remembered images" that are held
in common to recreate the meaning of the fundamental themes of their society.2' The force
of the historical tradition depends not only on a story's images and plot but also on an indi-
vidual's experiences with that familiar tale-dimly recalled memories that resonate and echo
through the emotionally-felt real-life experiences of the members of the audience. When

HISTORICAL TRADITION AND THE SITUATIONAL DEPLOYMENT OF STORY

Vansina observes, "oral tradition is a memory of memories in the most literal way," he must
also be talking about the Jie historical tradition.22 The performance of the historical tradition
is not a simple narration of certain past events but a poetical reflection on the events.
The congruence of the Jie historical tradition with the ceremonial narrative perfor-
mances of the Rwala Bedouin, oriki of Okuku people, and the ntsomi traditions of rural
Xhosa people suggests some common ground for interpretation. Indeed there is a possibility
for fruitful dialogue between the students of Middle Eastern and African historical tradi-
tions.
Jie Historical Tradition as Performance Art
Of all the storytellers with whom I spoke, Lodoch was perhaps the most articulate, steeped
in his tradition and best equipped to explain the oral traditions of his society. I had the
unique opportunity to become his apprentice in Jie oral tradition, and what I share here is
based on the extensive commentaries of Lodoch as well as of numerous other storytellers. All
of these storytellers were enthusiastic and generous in sharing their knowledge of their tradi-
tions with me, as I shared with them my knowledge of the Kurdish-Turkish oral traditions
from my own background. In this sense we engaged in collaborative work and exchanged
ideas. When sharing the meaning of the historical tradition with me, the storytellers were
passionate to include in that genre the biographical stories of people who lived in the recent
past. Nacham, one of the Jie storytellers I interviewed, explained:
When people fight, when people refuse to share food and water, when the sons rebel
against their fathers and when the fathers mistreat their sons and their daughters, people
would remember the story of Koryang, the story of Nakol and others, as well as the mistreat-
ment of Lodiny by Orwakol and Nayeche's mistreatment by her brothers. Or the mistreat-
ment of the Kadokini people by the Rengen people. The storytellers create historical tradi-
tions in much the same way they create folktales. They manipulate images and patterns of
past and present time as they manipulate the images of the animals and humans in folktales.23
Like Nacham, Lodoch too revealed to me the artistic and poetic implications of the
stories told during peace ceremonies which we both attended. During performances, Lodoch
usually sat next to me and revealed to me the art of Jie storytellers, commenting on how they
created and developed their characters and whether they tied the images of tradition with
the contemporary circumstances effectively. Storytellers always communicated important
messages relevant to the present contexts; they repeated again and again that their present
homeland was the land of their ancestors, and that community members should respect their
mythic sanctions and share the resources handed down to them.
Whenever we gathered with the elders under the trees, in the cattle enclosures or in the
dry iver beds to settle disputes and resolve conflicts, they would sit in a semi-circle, telling
stories about "bygone days," "gossiping" about raiding, recent or past conflicts over water

for the kraals (cattle pens), or various other contemporary local situations.24 Their conversa-
tions were dramatic and their words lofty when they talked about the ways of the ancestors
who settled along the banks of Longiro River, how they resolved past conflicts so admirably
and lived in peace, generously shared water, pasture and food, until the coming of AK-47s.
"The guns," they would say, "shattered our world and destroyed friendships between
brothers, fathers and sons, and between tribes."
The young men of today are hungry and greedy for power and cattle. They no
longer share the water and pasture; the wells and pastures are no one's possession.
They [these resources] belong to our ancestors, but with their guns a few young
men get together and claim ownership to the rivers and hills of our ancestors. They
ambush innocent people and deprive them of their cattle, usurping their women
and children. Where is the humanity of the ancestors?25
Thus they would question their contemporary situations. During such gatherings, they
would often recall past famines and the political crises of their youth; they would talk about
how they sumptuously feasted together during times of peace and abundance and how they
survived together, helping each other during prolonged dry seasons and devastating fam-
ines. They would occasionally remember certain epidemics that wiped out their cattle, how
they shared the milk of few emaciated cattle and ate the atap (bread) made from what few
grains they had.
With their lofty phrases, the storytellers would juxtapose the tainted contemporary
world with the memories of their youth and with the inherited memory images of their
ancestors, elevating their times and situations to the level of their ancestors and mythic be-
ginnings as depicted in the historical tradition. This artistic creation of the past is no differ-
ent than the creation of the fabulous realms of ntsomi of Xhosa, oriki of the Okuku, or the
ceremonial narratives of the Bedouin people. The poetic exchanges between the elders often
transported members of the audience to the metaphoric centers of the ancestral past, to the
epic world, "the world of the true heroes," as they would say.
Performances usually began with the storyteller's act of invoking the names of an-
cestral figures, collectively remembered for their exemplary deeds, in order to establish the
theme for his performance. They told of specific journeys of ancestral heroes and heroines
such as Nayeche and the gray bull Engiro, Orwakol and Lodiny on the waterless landscape.
The journeys and pauses, famines and feasts, sharing or refusal to share food and water in
the desolate landscape encapsulate "whatever is worth remembering," in Barber's sense of
the phrase. Through these fragments of memory images found in the historical tradition,
the storyteller reaffirms people's connections with one another, and even resolves present
political dilemmas.
As Barber points out in the case of oriki traditions, the memory images found in the
Jie oral tradition should not be considered mere "historical messages" representing certain
events.26 The corpus of historical traditions I collected during my research indicate that

180

HISTORICAL TRADITION AND THE SITUATIONAL DEPLOYMENT OF STORY

the images of the historical tradition do not have one-to-one representational relationships
with reality. Instead, they articulate diverse conventionalized discursive messages and they
are produced in different contexts, during different times in front of different audiences.
The Jie historical tradition takes on new shape and new meaning depending on the context
of a given performance. As Bauman argues, in a theoretical way the structure and interac-
tions in each performance influence the meaning of the oral tradition as each performance
is dialogically played out within the context of the situated action.27 Similar to the oriki or
ntsomi traditions, the performance context enters into a narration of the past in constitutive
way and becomes a part of the historical tradition. As Albert Lord argued, "the moment of
composition is the performance," and hence "composition and performance are the aspects
of same moment."'28 The storytellers are the composers and creators of the oral tradition; the
teller of the oral tradition is not a mere carrier of oral tradition, but the creator of the oral
tradition. The members of the audience both witness and actively participate in the act of
creating the historical tradition. In Jie historical tradition, the processes of identification and
of performance are intertwined with a fresh cluster of social connotations and verbal icons
of events, producing a "semantic open-endedness" evolving together dialogically within
contemporary contexts.
During Jie performances, as with oriki and ceremonial narratives, the images of the his-
torical tradition catalog kinship ties between those who are in adverse relationships and those
who arc friends at the present time. Sharing the memories of ancestors enhances social and
political strategies and differentiates friends from enemies. Following Scheub, Barber, and
Meeker, I stress the relationship between the poetic composition of oral art and the everyday
experiences of the Jie people that play a significant role in formulating their sense of self. The
plots and images of the historical tradition allow the Jie and their neighbors, the Turkana
people, to frame their experiences on the model-lives of their ancestors. In Jie culture, the
concept of being vulnerable in an unpredictable environment is poetic and "persuasive."
As "persuasive discourse," it can be analyzed according to the methodologies of previous
researchers.29 The performances are of the historical tradition is an attempt to persuade the
audience to act as reasonably as did their venerable ancestors in their own unpredictable situ-
ations in their difficult environment.
Narratives and Themes of the Historical Tradition
Plot in the historical tradition is linear, and narrative events unfold in a temporal sequence.
Each story involves a series of events that are believed to have happened in the past, and
hence they deal with the lived experiences of the ancestors, given a structure to the cultural
experience. The storytellers' artful arrangement of the plot molds fragments of memory im-
ages into a story. Performance of the historical tradition involves integrating the memory im-
ages into narrative events with a movement from "conflict to resolution." As Scheub writes,

181

MUSTAFA KEMAL MIRZELER

"narrative is not story," and "story is the totality of activities that comprise storytelling per-
formance, each of which is a crucial ingredient." Narration, he maintains, "the organization
of events," is not the most important thing "as far as the eventual experience of the story is
concerned."3 We can chart and "scientifically" analyze narratives, according to Scheub, but
such analysis tells very little about the story, which relies on the context of the performance.
Context prompts the storytellers to weave narrative, the performance event, and the mood
of the audience into the creation of the story.
As the plot of the story unfolds, ancestral heroes move from conflict to resolution,
toward reestablishing equilibrium and mending broken relations in a tainted contempo-
rary world. In Jie tradition, Orwakol helped the Lodiny people during the long dry sea-
son; Orwakol offered to share the pasture and water and invited Lodiny and his people
to Dadai. In similar circumstances, Kadanya aided his people; after settling near the Apule
River, people suffered from hunger and diseases. Akuj told Kadanya in a dream how to help
his people survive. In a complimentary story, Apobclo had a dream and instructed people to
go and bring Nairanabwo, a great prophet who lived near Loongor Well in Acholi land, to
Najie in order to help people rescue their grain from disease and infestation. So too does the
historical tradition encourage reasonable behavior: when people in the villages became un-
reasonable with their requests for cattle, Orwakol, as a young kraal leader, moved his kraals
farther and farther away from the village in order to avoid conflict. These images from the
historical tradition assist the contemporary Jie people as they try to adjust themselves toward
a balanced society.
Skilful storytellers bring lessons learned in the past back to the contemporary world as
they contextualize and communicate norms for basic human relations and moral standards.
The storytellers manipulate the images of the historical tradition as a kind of language in
their attempts to create a positive human world within the model of the ancestral world.
The memory images of the historical tradition are stock types and they are well known to
the members of the audience, as these individuals have experienced similar situations in their
diverse social relations. The storytellers use these images, creating a multiplicity of meanings
and symbolic connotations in order to dramatize any threats to society and the social order.
Orwakol is an ancestral hero and great kraal leader. In narrative, this founder of the Jie
society unites the diverse constituents of the society and brings them to the land, which they
now occupy; yet he has an insatiable need to accumulate cattle. Orwakol mistreats Lodiny,
who determinedly wrests away Lodiny's cattle, ultimately causing Lodiny to leave Daidai
and establish his own homestead in Lokatap Rock. In another version of the story, Orwakol
falsely accuses Lodiny of adultery, ultimately causing Lodiny to build a new fire and start a
new society. Thus Orwakol is not always portrayed as a redeeming ancestral figure.
Other ancestral heroes, such as Nayeche, are also ambiguously cast and not always
viewed as redeeming in their actions. Nayeche, like Lodiny, is mistreated by her brothers and
parents and chased away, but she survives and gives birth to the forebears of another society,

the Turkana. At other times however, she appears as rebellious girl who fights along with
other young people against elders in the kraal and refuses cattle to the people in the villages.
Surprisingly, she also saves people by offering them wild fruit. A third ambivalent character
is Lokolong. Sometimes depicted as an ideal ancestor, Lokolong rescues the society from
death and extinction by sharing the offspring of his bull, the only surviving bull in the entire
Najie. In other instances, however, Lokolong is portrayed as a ruthless man who demands
the peoples' only milk-cows in exchange for the offspring of his bull. His obsessive desire
to gather wealth turns him into the archetypal evil accumulator, a cattle-gobbling monster.
Diverse qualities of heroes are symbolically highlighted by storytellers during their
performances, according to their contexts. These clusters of diverse meanings and identi-
ties attached to the characters of the historical tradition give "plastic possibilities" (Barber's
term) to their traditions. These meanings and identities enable the storytellers to manipulate
figures and images according to the needs of a specific context.
The "truth" of the historical tradition derives from its associations with the varied
nature of human experience and the possibilities conveyed by its metaphorical content. The
accuracy with which a tradition conveys historical events is of less concern to the individu-
als involved in these performances. In their performances the content and form of the Jie
historical tradition are never still; they are hot, vibrant, and changing at each performance,
as the storytellers try to capture the essence of the past with all its troubling and redemptive
possibilities in various contexts. Unlike historians, who capture, arrest and fix the motion of
history in still chronologies, the storytellers celebrate the motion inherent in stories which
are central to their art and thought.
Through their performances the storytellers (re)create themselves as bearers of the
ancestral moral standard. In this regard, historical tradition can also be considered the tra-
dition of personal life. In fact the Jie people perform these traditions in specific social con-
texts, articulating their emotions about their personal lives and their social relationships.3'
Vulnerability, which is crucial to the Jie experience, links together in interdependencies par-
ent and child, people in sedentary villages and those living at kraals, and different ethnic
communities occupying distinct ecological zones and practicing different economic activi-
ties. Nowhere are notions of vulnerability and interdependence more clearly articulated than
in the plots of the Jie historical tradition. In addition, while the Jie historical tradition attests
to vulnerability and interdependence in all aspects of everyday fife, it also articulates indi-
viduals' desires to free themselves from the bonds of dependence.
In Jie tradition, refusal to share food or water among close friends, kin and strangers
can be a sign of rejection. The denial of such vital resources is among the most common
of themes of the historical tradition; this denial causes the separation of ancestral kin or the
dispersal of clans, leading to sentiments of rejection and loss. When people experience such
rejection they often invoke memory images which articulate the sentiments and idioms of

sharing in order to remind people of their obligations to share scarce resources and to pro-
tect human life.
This point was well illustrated in a performance which took place on June 12, 1997,
in Jimos village. The performance was prompted by circumstances involving a young man
in his early thirties, whom I shall call Lomoye. A close friend of mine, Lomoye often visited
the Jimos village and stayed with other young men, tending a few herds that remained in the
village, and doing various odd jobs as needed, in exchange for food, beer, and tobacco. One
day he came to help Urien to water his cattle. Urien was always happy to see Lomoye, and
soon he invited him and me to join him in a sacrifice, which was to be held in a bush on the
banks of Longiro River near Daidai.
When we arrived in the place, young men were cooking and serving older men the
cooked meat and we were greeted by the people there and offered some meat and beer.
Lomoye, I noticed, sat reservedly in the corner and waited, but nobody offered him food or
beer. Lomoye sat in the corner for awhile until a young man rudely approached him and told
him to leave. Feeling rejected and uncomfortable, Lomoye silently left the site of sacrifice. As
Lomoye was walking away, an old man, whom I shall call Lokodoi, got up quickly, leaning
on his staff. Wrapping his sheet around his body Lokodoi moved toward Lomoye, summon-
ing him to give him a piece of meat he was eating. This gesture was very powerful, as all the
other men who were busy eating remained silent and watched Lokodoi giving Lomoye his
portion of the meat. Lokodoi was irritated by the behavior of the young man who refused
the food to Lomoye, and left the ritual ground and went back to the village and, I was later
told, spent the whole night hungry.
The next day Lokodoi remained aloof and quiet, and said nothing about what hap-
pened the day before. That night I, Lodoch and Urien joined Lokodoi in his etem, his men's
gathering place. Lokodoi sat on the sandy ground, next to him sat Lomoye and a few other
men near the flickering fire, as the flames lit his face at intervals. After greetings and drinking
beer, Lokodoi told a story that showed how he felt about the mistreatment Lomoye received
from the young men on the ritual ground. The story conveyed the pain of rejection in a
rather amusing way; with his poetic voice and rhythmically shifting expressions and mimes,
Lokodoi criticized the Rengen people for their greed and refusal to share resources with
the Kadokini people. Entrancing the audience with his performance, Lokodoi stressed the
importance of generosity and sharing, no matter how puny the resources were.
Here is the text of the story which I recorded during the performance, followed by the
translation into English:
Aperi kuwar neniti eyai akoroo apotu Ngirengen toyara akuma tonyama emany

During a prolonged famine, the Rengen people killed a tortoise and ate its liver.
They refused to share it with the Kodokini people. The Kodokini people separated
(from the Rengen people) as the people of kraals usually separate. I don't know
how many Kodokini people there were when they left, but if you go to Kodokini
now, you will see that Kodokini is large. Long ago the people of Kodokini were very
few, and the land was vacant. There were not very many people living in that land.
When the Kodokini people left the land of Rengen, they went to get women
from Panyangara and Nakapelimoru. They then settled in the middle of Panyangara
and Nakapelimoru. They became strong again and stayed there. The Kodokini peo-
ple asked themselves, "What is the use of moving back from here to Rengen? Let
us stay here. Our customs are the same as those of Rengen and we already know
them."
When the Kodokini people performed their ceremonies there (the new-found
land in between Panyangara and Nakapelimoru) they followed the customs of
Lodiny people. When they killed the bull, they killed it in the same way as Lodiny's
people did. When they made their fire they sat at the southern-most part and faced
to the north side of Lodiny.
The division of these people did not matter-they remained as Rengen, the
people of Lodiny. Even now, when people kill a bull within the land of Orwakol,
the Kodokini people come and sit with them. They receive their share as visitors
in respect of peace of sharing food. Now the Kodokini shrine is different than the
shrines of Orwakol.
In Kodokini they have their own shrine, but when they kill a cow, it is killed the
same way the people of Lodiny kill a cow. When the Kodokini people kill a bull, the
Orwakol people go there and sit as visitors.
Lokodoi's representation of the memory images in the historical tradition appeals to the
moral authority of the venerable ancestors, encouraging people to meet their social and
political obligations, to cooperate and to share their scarce resources. Various versions of the
Kadokini story are well known in lie society and they unambiguously express the importance
of sharing a resource, even if it is as small as the liver of a tortoise.32

Although the story was about the Rengen people's ancient conflict with the Kadokini
people over the sharing of food, the story also referred to the young man's inhospitable
treatment of Lomoye the day before. By narrating the story of Kadokini, Lokodoi was draw-
ing the audience's attention to the moral responsibility of sharing food and resources in
social interactions. Although Lomoye was in the audience and could have admitted the
pain of being rejected and humiliated, he ignored the apparent message of the story which
conveyed how he must have felt after that mistreatment and rejection. At the end of his
performance, Lokodoi stated, "the refusal of food is the ultimate rejection." With his story
Lokodoi powerfully illustrated the implication of rejection through the formulaic medium
of the historical tradition. The ancient memory images of the Kadokini people's experience
carried a discourse and experience which Lomoye lived through in the present; concurrently,
Lomoye's experience provided the social context for the performance of the historical tradi-
tion. In everyday experience, people react differently to the refusal and rejection of food, wa-
ter, pasture and other scarce resources in Najie, but Lokodoi's performance of the historical
tradition mirrored the ancestral complex of denial described and detailed in the story. The
performance had the impact it had because audience members shared certain experience and
knowledge of his chosen images. Common experience provided the communion between
the performer and the audience and they both came to terms with the reality of living in an
environment where resources are scarce and survival depends on sharing; this is perhaps why
the plots of Jie historical traditions are usually set in the long dry seasons, when the society
experiences political and environmental crises.
The story of Kodokini is not the only explanatory story that refers to ancestral in-
cidents. Certain versions of the stories of Lodiny and Orwakol, Nayeche and Ngolengiro
preserve these explanatory themes for human relations, embodying the troubling memories
which force the Jie people to redefine their social relations in contemporary contexts.
A similar historical tradition was invoked by Rianaro one evening in 1996. It was
prompted by the actions of a man whom I shall call Lowotomoe-the owner of a famed,
powerful bull also named Lowotomoe. The story transpired in the kraal in Koteen
where both Lowotomoe's and Rianaro's cattle grazed. Rianaro, who apparently wanted
Lowotomoe's famous bull to mount his cows, made several attempts to convince him but
Lowotomoe persistently rejected the request. Rianaro and other people in the kraal consid-
ered Lowotomoe's refusal to be parsimonious, shameful, and unfriendly. Finally, one eve-
ning Rianaro confronted Lowotomoe for his unfriendly gesture and decided to discuss this
matter with his friends and close kin in his etem in the kraal. He sent a message to people in
the villages asking several of his kin to join him in the kraal. Lodoch and I joined the group
and went to Koteen to participate in the discussion.
On that moonlit night, several men sat on the course of the dry riverbed around the
campfire and talked and talked.33 The discussion that night focused on the discourse of
friendship and sharing, as they made references to various heroic leaders of the historical

HISTORICAL TRADITION AND THE SITUATIONAL DEPLOYMENT OF STORY

tradition, juxtaposing the images of the historical tradition with the conflicting feelings and
motivations of Lowotomoe. The conversations, for the most part, concerned the ordinary
social relations between kin and friends who share the same kraal; these individuals expected
Lowotomoe to behave as a Jie man who knows the meaning of friendship; they suggested
that a good friend should not refuse the offspring of his bull to his friend, as this would
constitute an improper behavior for a friend who shares the same kraal. At a chosen mo-
ment during the conversation, Rianaro cleared his throat and, preparing for a long chat, said,
"Lowotomoe should not have refused the offspring of his bull, to his brother who helped
him with bride-wealth when he took the second wife. A friend should not refuse his bull to
a friend who experienced the pain of hunger with you. A friend should uphold the standard
of friendship and brotherhood and preserve the images of our forefather."
Wounded by the behavior of Lowotomoe, Rianaro narrated the story of Lokolong
and his bull Ngolengiro, a well known story about the only bull that survived the famine
and cattle disease of a time long ago. With this story, he took his predicament and placed it
into the resonant embrace of ancient fragments of memory images from his oral tradition,
thus linking the action of Lowotomoe to the mythical essence of his culture. In his narrative
of the bull of Lokolong, Rianaro tenderly rendered the images of the past as comments on
Lowotomoe's behavior.
While Rianaro was narrating, Lodoch sat on the sandy ground next to him. The silvery
moonlight lit the entire Plateau as the Koteen Hill cast a long shadow, concealing the dry
riverbed. The songs of young herders in distant kraals rose and fell in the darkness of the
night, at intervals here and there as Rianaro composed his story. Rianaro's skinny face shone
behind the flickering fire and his body movement and facial expressions were observable as
he unfolded the story of Ngolengiro, animating the unforgotten memory of Lokolong's
bull, the only bull that survived that terrible famine and the unbearable heat that parched
the land. The brown earth burned like ashes and cattle and people died of disease, thirst, and
hunger:

There remained only the bull of Lokolong from Panyangara. The bull remained
alone and there was a single cow in every clan. The Rengen people were left with
only one cow; Kanawat was also left with only one cow; all the clans in Najie re-
mained with only one cow each. There remained only one bull, the bull of Lokolong
from Panyangara. Everybody took his cow to the bull of Lokolong. So and so took
his cow to that bull; so and so from another village also took his cow to that bull.
The bull mounted these cows. The cows stayed in Lokolong's homestead and when
a cow delivered a calf, Lokolong milked that cow until her calf had grown big.
When a calf grew big, Lokolong sent a message to the owner and said, "Come
for your cow." The bull of Lokolong was the only bull remaining in the whole of
Najie. Long ago, that one bull mounted all of the cattle. So because of the bull of
Lokolong, all the cattle multiplied. Had the bull of Lokolong not been there, there
would have been no cattle in Najie today.
Rianaro's enthralling voice expressed intense longing for the past. His sorrowful and shift-
ing expressions, the poetic movement of his body actively engaged the members of the
audience and connected them with the time of Lokolong and his bull of long ago. The
audience, entranced by Rianaro's poetic voice and gesture, became part of the performance.
Lodoch, with precise timing, sang a song with his poetic voice complimenting the patterns
of Rianaro's narrative. Soon the members of the audience all joined the song:

The voices of the audience members theorized the story, and their song became an approv-
ing commentary on the tradition and narrative that Rianaro was performing. After the song,
Rianaro continued his performance, this time repeating how the bull of Lokolong saved
the whole of Najie from total disappearance, miming the actions of the narrative. Rianaro's
dance-like movements heavily symbolized his direct response to Lowotomoe's refusal. The
song condensed the experience of Rianaro with the repertory of remembered memory im-
ages from a well known story. The levels of engagement that Rianaro's performance created,
punctuated by the music of unspoken words, body movement and emotion, transported
all who were present-members of the audience and the storyteller-to the metaphoric
center of remembered memories, enabling them experience the thin boundary between
present and the metaphoric past, the "ancient" moments of the ancestors, as Scheub would
suggest.38
The images of the story and the story itself reveal fundamental themes which the
members of the audience must value. Although a version of this historical tradition has been
analyzed by Lamphear for its historical significance,39 versions of the particular narrative may
be analyzed on many levels, and I wish to make a few points regarding the Rianaro's per-
formance and its context. First, the moral of the story centers on the importance of sharing
during hard times, but the tale also carries the messages about the vulnerability of cattle as a
form of domestic wealth. The refusal to share the offspring of one's cattle threatens not only
the Jie people's fundamental ancestral values but also the existence of cattle, the foundation
of Jie society. In this story there is only one bull, like the gray bull Engiro, the father of all the
cattle40 Ngolengiro redeems the Jie cattle by a contribution to procreation; like the father,
he embodies the power of fertility. Thus, Ngolengiro's mounting of the emaciated cattle of

the clans closely ties the positive association of procreation with the human value of sharing.
By presenting Ngolengiro as the only surviving bull, the father of all the cattle, the story
carries messages about the moral responsibility of a father, and his moral worth. This confla-
tion of cattle and wealth-symbolism balances the importance of sharing in conjunction with
procreation and multiplication of society. The story thus articulates the norms of sharing,
driven by procreation and multiplication, as virtuous human behavior.
Through its depiction of the procreation of cattle in the midst of famine and ecologi-
cal disaster, the story suggests that the virtuosity of sharing can counteract the threat of loss
and disaster. First, decent human behavior entails sharing and helping others to survive, as
symbolized by Lokolong, who, in contributing to the procreation of cattle, prevents the
loss of all the society's domestic wealth. In social life this might be equivalent to a man who
maintains the family herd and his close kin. Second, although Lokolong is generous, he nev-
ertheless happily receives whatever is due to him, which identifies not only the importance
of giving but also of receiving. Thus the story suggests reciprocity as a critical foundation for
moral virtue.
In the performance of this historical tradition, associations between past and pres-
ent figures are intertwined; Lokolong is identified with Orwakol, whose bull mounted the
cattle of Jie on the model of Engiro and fathered all the Jie and Turkana cattle. Lokolong
is responsible and honorable like Orwakol by taking proper action and enabling his society
to survive, in particular through the procreative power of his bull. With his performance,
Rianaro expects Lowotomoe to confirm to ancestral ideals and share the offspring of his
bull. Lowotomoe's denial of his bull's offspring can be transmuted into the etiquette of
morality by which individual worth is judged. As sharing and cooperating between friends
is understood as a moral responsibility, Lowotomoe's denial is interpreted as deviation from
the standard norms which the ancestors established.
The two performances demonstrate how storytellers manipulate memory images into
patterns, though their moralizing messages may perhaps have little to do with the actual
events involving Lomoye and Rianaro, respectively. The storytellers' artistic ordering of the
plots of the historical tradition illuminates the essence of their contemporary experiences.
The fertile seeds of both stories are the memory images which elicit emotions in Scheub's
sense, and, reveal messages relevant to contemporary situations and remain recognizable
to the audiences. The two stories are consistent with fantastic tales: in one, we witness the
sharing of a tortoise liver; in the second, we find a mythical theme borrowed from the story
of the gray bull Engiro, the father of all the Jie cattle. In the first story of the Kadokini,
major clan members eat the liver among themselves, refusing to share with the members
of the minor clan, thus reminding them of their marginal relationship to the mainstream
community. Ultimately the Kadokini people become upset and leave the society. Thus moral
implication of the story is plain: one has an obligation to share food and resources with oth-
ers, even though the others may not be members of the society or family. The force of the

190

HISTORICAL TRADITION AND THE SITUATIONAL DEPLOYMENT OF STORY

story, however, is in its context. The emotional implication of the story has to do with the
predicament of Lomoye, who was denied food and who, as a poor single man without fam-
ily, is a marginal figure. The "fantasy image" (Scheub's phrase)41 here helps the storyteller to
emphasize the fact that no matter the size of the sacrificial meal, it would have been enough
for people to share the meat with Lomoye. In this way, it becomes clear that the crux of the
story is not the incident of Kadokini in history long ago, but how Lomoye was treated by
people during the sacrificial feast. Here, performance provides fanciful yet rich and power-
ful symbolic associations for the predicament of Lomoye, as the storyteller makes the point
that the pattern of Kadokini experience continues in the present and has become real again
when Lomoye is denied food. Within the performance context-the refusal of food by an
irresponsible provider of the sacrifice-the storyteller observes a pattern in the basic human
need for food and the consequences of denial and irresponsibility.
When the audience members broke into song during Rianaro's performance, they
demonstrated an intense emotional response to the well-known image of Lokolong's only
bull. Emotions elicited by the song communicate friendship, "political investment" and
tribal identity, as Meeker points out in the case of the Bedouin society.42 The verses of the
song confirm proper behavior: the sharing of the bull's procreative power, an investment in
economic security, and the friendship such investment could afford. As the song works the
images of the story into patterns, the members of the audience express their sympathy with
Rianaro by joining him with their song. The plot of this story is constructed around two
interrelated patterns and each build on the other. In the first pattern, the Jie people are in the
middle of ecological disaster, experiencing societal crises and are confronted with life-and-
death issues of cattle disease and famine. The only way to survive is to replenish the loss of
cattle through procreation. The society depends on the only bull, the bull of Lokolong, and
he recognizes this and cooperates with the members of the society. Lowotomoe, the antith-
esis of Lokolong, refuses the offspring of his bull to his friend, and thus he becomes a part
of the pattern of the tainted contemporary world. The storyteller unites the two different
characters, the venerable Lokolong, an ideal ancestral character who is concerned with the
survival of society, and the greedy and uncooperative Lowotomoe, a corrupted, contempo-
rary image. With their songs the members of the audience send a message to Lowotomoe:
to send his bull to mount the cows of Rianaro. In fact, the song functions as an indirect
invitation to Lowotomoe (who, though not in the audience, was near the kraal and likely
within hearing distance) to behave as his ancestors did: to volunteer his bull and preserve
the sense of oneness and unity created by the ancestors. After all, his bull is a descendent of
Lokolong's bull, just as Rianaro's cows are descended from that mythical stock. The patterns
unite the predicament of Rianaro with the past events found in the fantasy images of the
historical tradition.
The point here is that, like all memories, historical traditions have a strong basis in the
emotions. The artistic composition of the stories elicits emotional responses, whether they

191

are denials, refusals or rejections, from the audience members. Storytellers must use their
artistic manipulations to reshape these emotional outbursts into narrative form and give
contemporary meaning to the stories. The obvious discourses articulated by the storytell-
ers within powerful performance contexts unite the members of the audience. The artistic
representation of the sharing of food, water, pasture, and cattle, and the cyclical patterns
of famines draw the members of the audience into this union. The emotional resonance of
these traditional images is the single most important unifying force that the storytellers can
manipulate, as they fashion emotion and image into a linear plot, arranging the fragments
of memory that capture and communicate vital human experiences, just as do the oriki of
Okuku, ntsomi stories of the Xhosa, and the ceremonial narratives of the Bedouin.

Ngolengiro back to their home.
35. The phrase emphasizes that when the bull Ngolengiro went to Dodos, the Jie people used their
clubs rather than sticks to drive Ngolengiro back to Najie. The verse emphasizes the extreme
measures the Jie people took in guarding their only bull Ngolengiro from the Dodos people. Note
the contrast when the bull went to Turkana land: the Jie people have much closer ancestral ties
with the Turkana as opposed to the Dodos people, hence their annoyance and use of clubs instead
of sticks to drive the bull back home. The storyteller also uses the adjective cho in order to indicate
sorrow over the fact that the bull went to Dodos.
36. Again, the Jie people used sticks in driving the bull back home from Katap (Acholi), indicating the
closer relationship of the Jie with the Katap people. It was not necessary for them to use clubs.
37. This time the storyteller indicates that when the bull went to Turkana land for the second time,
the Jie people who used sticks the first time now used clubs to bring the bull back home, now
determined to prevent the bull from going back to the Turkana.

MODERN ORAL TRADITION AND THE HISTORIC KINGDOM OF KONGO

Modern Oral Tradition and the
Historic Kingdom of Kongo1
JOHN THORNTON, BOSTON UNIVERSITY
he oral traditions of the Kingdom of Kongo provide a rich and particularly detailed
examination of the sort of work on oral tradition that David Henige reveled in.
Kongo, almost alone in Africa has both an extensive and well recorded oral tradi-
-  tion, and a very deep documentary tradition. Not only is Kongo's documentary
tradition extensive, but it includes an extraordinarily large number of sources authored by
Kongolese.2 Thus it is possible to trace the kingdom's history in detail using documents
alone, and moreover one can even make a fairly good stab at it using only Kongo-generated
documentation alone. It is not surprising then, that Jan Vansina presented Kongo as one of
the many societies that could be fruitfilly studied by both written and oral traditions in his
classic work on Central African history.3
While a great deal has been written about, and from, the written sources of Kongo his-
tory, much less has been done about its oral traditions. It is not that they are not taken into
consideration, but only that relatively speaking they have been less fully considered. Even
in Vansina's classic Kingdoms of the Savanna, in many ways an exemplary study intended
to show the value of oral tradition for the recovery of the undocumented African past,
the Kongo sections are written overwhelmingly from contemporary documentary sources.
This is because the oral traditions collected today present a fiundamental problem to any
researcher, which is that if one only uses oral traditions to reconstruct the past of Kongo, the
past they present is radically different from that presented by the documents. This mismatch
in information has puzzled historians, who have coped with it through a variety of strategies.
The traditions of Kongo seem to describe the country as being a very decentralized
federation of clans. The history of the clan (kanda) is the foundation, and it describes the
activities of the clans more or less in isolation from the rest of the country.Although there is
a king in the traditions, his role seems very limited, for it is the clans that take all the action,

and that action in turn is very local, describing the movements of small groups of people and
some of their interactions. Most of the action of the kingdom appears to be more symbolic
than real, and for that matter there is relatively little action described in them, save for migra-
tions.
This kingdom of clans is radically different from the one that can be described from
both Kongo documents and the reports of visitors. In their accounts as frequently syn-
thesized in books since Adolph Ihe's 1929 treatment, Jean Cuvelier's influential L'ancien
royaume du Congo, published in French in 1946, the rapid fire contributions of Georges
Balandier, W. G. L. Randles and Jan Vansina between 1965 and 1968, and even later efforts
by myself and Ann Hilton, Kongo is a centralized, even bureaucratic entity, with a powerful
king and a great deal of high intrigue.4 There is, in fact, no place for migrating clans in this
history, any more than there is a place for a bureaucratic kingdom in the traditions of the
clans.
All of the historians and anthropologists have had to resolve this contradiction in a
variety of ways. The early Baptist missionaries, for example, simply denied that Kongo had
ever been as described in the texts, which they felt was simply a misinformed speculation
of foreigners. But such opinions simply could not survive moderately careful scrutiny of
existing documentation, especially after the publication of Paiva Manso's Hist6ria do Reino
de Congo in 1877.5 Ant6nio Custodio Gonqalves has come closest to making clan histories
the guiding principle in more recent historiography, by taking the structure of clannic in-
teraction as a language for understanding the activities of the kings without really tapping
clan histories for information.6 And most scholars feel obliged to integrate clan histories in
other ways. The majority of scholars have tended to follow the solution proposed by Jean
Cuvelier in 1930 and developed more thoroughly in 1946, which was to displace the clan
traditions to the period before the arrival of the Portuguese, as being from the formative
period of the kingdom, and then to continue from the arrival of the Portuguese using only
the documents.7 Cuvelier also augmented this technique by including traditions and prov-
erbs to reinforce information received from older texts. For example, to describe the flight of
the partisans of Mpanzu, Afonso's half brother and rival following Afonso's victory over his
opponent in 1506, Cuvelier drew on the migration tradition of the Mpanzu clan to recount
movements.' Elsewhere, in order to identify the first members of the Kongo nobility to be
baptized, he found clan mottos that stressed their baptisms, such as Nkenge eLau, whose
motto explicitly says, "Ntete ndia mungwa muna Kongo" (I was the first to "eat salt" [be
baptized] in Kongo).9
In 1983, I proposed a different model, suggesting that the clan traditions related to
the eighteenth century when the kingdom lost its central unity, and subsequently I revised
my own position to the one I hold today, which is that on the whole the clan traditions relate
to an even later period, roughly after 1850.10 Both my solution and the one proposed by

MODERN ORAL TRADITION AND THE HISTORIC KINGDOM OF KONGO

Cuvelier rely on the same idea, that is, that the traditions usually relate to a different time
from the documentation, either earlier than their scope or later.
Collecting and Presenting Tradition: The Redemptorist Project
No work on Kongo tradition can avoid the influence of the Belgian Redemptorist mis-
sionaries, especially Jean Cuvelier, the bishop of Matadi, and his colleague and intellectual
successor Joseph de Munck. Cuvelier and his colleagues sought to harness the pride that
Kongos had in their history and past to evangelical ends by recalling both their traditions
and their documentary past. It was his hope that he could marry the love of traditions that
many Kongos had to the knowledge that there was a Christian past that could be developed
or redeveloped for a Catholic future. When he was appointed inspector of schools for the
Kikongo speaking part of Belgian Congo in 1926, he availed himself of the opportunity
for travel that this position presented to collect tradition systematically all over the region.1
He, and sometimes his informants, wrote what they collected in small school notebooks,
which were usually entitled simply "Mvila," the Kikongo word for a clan's praise name.
There are some 50 such notebooks surviving in the Redemptorist archives, now held at the
Catholic University in Leuven/Louvain, Belgium.'2 Cuvelier actually began presenting his
ideas systematically in a series of articles that he published in the Kikongo language mission
newspaper, Kukiele in 1928. In these articles, generically entitled "Mambu ma kinza nkulu
a nsi a Kongo," Cuvelier produced a synthetic history of Kongo, citing and using clan tradi-
tions and trying to cross their information with that in documents. Cuvelier's long 1930-31
French article on Kongo traditions in the colonial journal Congo introduced Western schol-
ars to the world of tradition and presented many samples of translations of them, integrated
into a historical narrative and defending his solution to their problems. Although formally
engaging in the same task as he did in "Mambu ma kinza nkulu," the narrative structure
of the French article was much more academic in nature than that "Mambu" which started
with long slightly reworked quotations from the traditions giving the work the feel of a
traditional narrative.
In 1934, Cuvelier published a very large if not complete set of the traditions he had
collected in the 110 page book, Nkutama a mvila za makanda. It was encyclopedic in na-
ture as indicated by the title, as Nkutama in Kikongo signifies a listing or encyclopedic con-
cept. Close to five hundred clan names can be found in the book, arranged alphabetically.
This book is certainly the most fundamental work on Kongo oral tradition ever published.
Along with his articles in Kukiele, Cuvelier presented a powerful body of sources as well as a
range of interpretations. As soon as it was published and distributed, Nkutama became the
bedrock of oral tradition in Kongo. Many families obtained copies of the book, and many
went into the clan treasuries, special boxes containing items of particular significance to the
clan including malungu (bracelets), other pieces of jewelry or metal objects, nkangi kiditu

197

(images of Jesus), documents of particular significance and the like. Typically such boxes are
held by mfumu za makanda (clan heads) and are carefilly guarded, perhaps secretly, and
passed down for generations. There are many ordinary families who own copies of at least
these books, as well as others in the same genre, for example, Tuka Kongo, a Jesuit publica-
tion with similar themes, or the historical reconstruction created by Joseph de Munck from
clan traditions and documents of foreign origin, Kinkulu kia nsi eto.'3 For many these are
the only books they have.14
Nkutama is still widely regarded as being the authoritative version of clan histories,
and can be and frequently is consulted on occasions of doubt. Prohibitions of marriage
between clans deemed too closely related to intermarry, noted in Nkutama, are consid-
ered today sufficient proof that marriages are blocked after reading them, even in Luanda."
Although the books were created and are systematically presented only for clans that lived
in the Belgian Congo in the 1920s, there are a few that could be found there collected in or
near Angola, or at the least of clans that have branches in Angola. Most Angolans recognize
that Nkutama is not a complete listing of all clans, and therefore defective, but many still
consider it authoritative for those clans it does contain. Subsequent editions of Nkutama
contained more clan names, and the final edition, published in 1972 edited by Joseph de
Munck, contains clans that were not in the original edition, for example those collected by
de Munck in later periods, particularly in Angola and included in the last edition.'6
While de Munck was vital in continuing the work on Nkutama, especially after
Cuvelier's death in 1962, he also compiled and wrote a second highly influential book,
Kinkulu kia nsi eto, first published in 1956 and then published in a second augmented edi-
tion in 1971.'1 Even before writing this book, de Munck was a dedicated collector of tradi-
tions, either in person or through the good offices of his catechists, who traveled far and
wide. In the 1960s and through the 1970s his workers traveled in Angola, systematically
visiting villages, making notes of historically significant sites, and actively seeking to connect
traditions to historical events described in documentary sources.'8 While Nkutama is simply
a list of clan histories, more or less raw data on clans, on the other hand, Kinkulu is a work of
history, combining Cuvelier's initial work of 1928 that included extensive use of European
language documentary sources, but then summarized and presented in schoolbook fashion.
Although it is a short work, it contains information that is not found in any other historical
work especially for the nineteenth century, based on clan traditions.19 It has also been instru-
mental in shaping oral tradition.
One of the most important legacies of this corpus of Redemptorist work, and its wide-
spread diffusion in Kikongo speaking Congo and Angola, has been its role in determining
modern oral tradition. People who claim to have special knowledge of tradition, or have
received them orally from their parents or other elders, either in groups, such as the explica-
tion that took place and perhaps still takes place in the traditional education of youth, even
outside the school system, often own copies and make particular use of such books.20 The

MODERN ORAL TRADITION AND THE HISTORIC KINGDOM OF KONGO

traditions presented on such occasions, usually by an elder with considerable knowledge,
were quite likely, after 1928, to be informed by the articles in Kukiele that began appearing
in that year and especially by Nkutama when it appeared in 1934, as well as existing tradi-
tions available to the clan, and passed on orally by a preceding generation. As the post-1928
generation passed into adulthood, they encountered other traditions based on similar mate-
rial and, even if illiterate, were likely to absorb at least some of the traditions that had been
presented in this way. As Henige noted in his work on oral tradition, this "feedback" tends
to reduce the variability of oral tradition but also renders it less creative and more like oral
versions of written texts.2'
Following the publication of Kinkulu kia Nsi eto in 1956, interpretations might also
tend to those favored by such works, and indeed, one can say that Cuvelier and de Munck's
version of the marriage of tradition and documents, retold in Kikongo in printed form, has
become the favored version of tradition and is now presented as the traditional version. It is,
of course, ultimately a synthetic version of tradition, using older oral materials, documents
and interpretation of missionary priests, but it can pass along orally without the participants
realizing how it was arrived at. In fact, in most people's conception, oral tradition is passed
down, by oral means only, during the night time stories of their youth by a respected elder,
who one imagines, received it in the same form in his youth, and backwards through a chain
of intergenerational gatherings to the time when the events themselves took place. That this
is not entirely the case makes modern oral tradition what it is-a combination of African
tradition and modern scholarship.
This is not to say that oral tradition is not creative in its own way of handling such
sources. For example, de Munck, seeking to present modern historical reconstruction to
Kongo students, told the story of the Bantu migrations in Kinkulu in such a way that it
might seem that the Kongos came from Egypt. In recent years, more and more elaborate
stories connecting Kongo and ancient Egypt have emerged, dressed in the finest traditional
clothes, and presented as the ancient history of the country. It is not as if the traditionalists
are making stories up, they might hear them in this, or similar forms from others orally. The
well know Angolan politician and intellectual, Miguel Ferraz Alberto has been passionate in
his evocation of Egyptian origins, which he has defended on the basis of tradition, linguistic
similarities, comparisons of regalia and reading of Biblical sources, and given his eloquence
and interests, one can expect that his interpretation of these matters, spoken in elegant and
proverb-rich Kikongo can pass into oral tradition as well.22
Oral Tradition and Beatriz Kimpa Vita
In fact, one can never be exactly sure where oral tradition will go. In 1998, I published a
biography of the famous Kongo prophet and religious leader, Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita.23 In
reviewing my work, Simon Bockie was critical of the book which he thought had only con-

199

JOHN THORNTON

sidered the point of view of Kimpa Vita's enemies, who were Europeans, and not that of the
Kongos themselves. He complained that I had not used oral traditions about Dona Beatriz
that, he said, were well known in his youth and that he had heard, in all probability by the fire
told by an elder, and which he further contended were well known throughout the Kikongo
speaking territory.24 While I did not seek to reply to his review, I was quite convinced that he
had simply heard fed back traditions that had surfaced following the publication of the first
of the documents concerning Dona Beatriz in 1953, perhaps through the publication of the
story in Kinkulu in 1956. I considered it important that Rafael Batsikama's biography of
Kimpa Vita, published in 1966 offered no information about her life from oral tradition.25
This was particularly telling, I thought, because he had made extensive use of the original
documentary material, and elsewhere in that book and in his other important book Voici les
Jaga he used Nkutama as well as proverbs and traditions which he had learned or collected
himself.26 It seemed to me that if there were traditions that were relevant circulating around
fires in Kongo and were well known, he would certainly have cited them.
When I did field work in Mbanza Kongo in 2002, I was taken to visit Agostinho
Afonso, a famous informant who lived in the lower town of the city and was reputed to be
versed in the history of Beatriz Kimpa Vita.27 He spoke in Kikongo, elegantly in the man-
ner of speaking often called "Kimfumu" which conveys both knowledge and authority. As I
listened to him speak, I noted that he frequently gave the names of people in French form,
for example calling the king of Kongo killed at Mbwila in 1665 as "Antoine," or calling the
names of the Italian priests who were witnesses to her death as Pere Laurent de Lucques
(Lorenzo da Lucca) and .B&amp;amp;rnard de Gallo (Bernardo da Gallo).28 He also included exact
dates for events, which is very uncommon if it is ever found in traditions. To me, although
I admired his delivery and his use of proverbs, I was sure that much of what he said had
been fed back from written sources that had appeared in French. After our session was over I
asked him to name his sources, and as I expected, he mentioned his father and mother, clan
elders and Radio Zaire.
However, recognizing that elements of tradition may be fed back should not obscure
the possibility that within them are other components which might just relate to knowledge
passed down orally through the generations. During his presentation, Afonso noted that
Beatriz' mother played a central role in the development of the movement. Indeed, as the
story progressed it seems she became more and more critical to the whole. As Beatriz was
killed by the priests, and indeed as the priests burned many people, it was Beatriz's mother,
it emerged, who continued the movement. Finally, he linked both Beatriz's teaching and
that of her mother to Bundu dia Kongo, a present day religious-political movement whose
spiritual and intellectual head is Muanda Nsemi. While Muanda Nsemi has himself written a
pamphiet on Dona Beatriz, it has little that is historical in it, certainly not fed back from writ-
ten sources nor clearly based on tradition.29 It is, however, clear that Bundu dia Kongo has
claimed descent from Kimpa Vita, either as a political ploy or because they have employed

200

MODERN ORAL TRADITION AND THE HISTORIC KINGDOM OF KONGO

similar sorts of tradition. Nor is this confined to Bundu dia Kongo, for in 2002, the cultural
affairs officer in Mbanza Kongo and avid collector of local lore and tradition, Pedro Gabriel,
related to me a tradition circulating in Mbanza Kongo that the Antonians always had a quar-
ter in the city, and that when the Baptists came, the Antonians went with the Baptists and the
Catholics remained where they were.30
While I can certainly recognize that there is feedback in the traditions about Kimpa
Vita today, and that modern political and religious movements are moving rapidly to in-
clude her among their founders, this does not preclude there being that kernel of truth that
makes legends so exciting and so frustrating. Is it possible that Kimpa Vita's mother did
play a role in continuing movement? Is it also possible that thanks to her efforts it might
have continued underground for centuries? There is little doubt that a "Mother of Saint
Anthony did indeed appear shortly after D Beatriz' death, as asserted in Father Lorenzo
da Lucca's eyewitness account of the aftermath of Beatriz' execution. Immediately another
woman came forward and preached as the Mother of the false Saint Anthony, comforting
the people not to be afraid, for if the "daughter was dead the Mother still remained," and
she made herself out to be called the "Mother of Virtue."3 Cuvelier's French translation of
the manuscript which contains this quotation was published in 1953, and was known, for
example to Batsikama when he wrote his work on D Beatriz. It is therefore possible that a
careful reader might have fed this statement back into tradition, from which it subsequently
developed into a potential branch to survive until the present. Still, it is a small section, one
that is easily overlooked, and published in an academic journal.32 It is possible that it is not
fed back, but a real survival of the movement, though on the whole it would seem not.
Oral Tradition and King Garcia IV
On the whole, however, I confess to being skeptical of the claims of oral tradition in Kongo.
I am prepared to accept that they do relate to historical events, but my own contention is
that for the most part they describe events of the middle to late nineteenth century. This is
based on my reading of traditions and the information contained in them. Traditions, as pre-
sented in Nkutama, and in the notebooks that underlie it, typically begin with a statement
of the mvila,the boast or praise name of the clan. These might be historically significant,
but many are not, for example "Nzinga wa zinga nsi.. ." (Nzinga circled the country...)
actually is a play on the verb zinga which serves as a root for the name. Following this, they
describe migrations from a variety of starting points, then following an itinerary such as this
one from Kabata, "Tuka mu Kongo, nsaukidi Luezi, ntokele muna Kintinu, ntungidi Sole
(Songololo), ntungid Nkanda (nkoko Luo), ntokele Kivuza, ntokele Tava...33 or "leaving
from Kongo I crossed the Luezi, I took up land in Kintinu, I built Sole (Songololo), I built
Nkanda (on the River Luo), I took up land in Kivuza, I took up land in Tava.. ." (the use
of the first person singular presumably represents the first founder's own description, but

JOHN THORNTON

other traditions use the first person plural, tutukidi, tusaukidi, tutokele, tutungidi, etc). The
text goes on to outline itineraries for other branches of the clan, giving their stopping places
on the migration as well.
My interpretation of this tradition, and the many others that resemble it, is that they
describe trade routes that developed in the 1850s and beyond in Kongo. During this period,
when commodity trade dominated the economic life of the region, traders, often based near
Soyo, or Boma or perhaps in Mbanza Kongo itself established villages or quarters of villages
at stopping points along the roads leading to the production centers of peanuts, rubber or
other export products. We know that this trade involved a considerable percentage of the
population and that having places where there were people who could protect one's goods
and receive travelers as family members was important. These centers then described tradi-
tions that allowed everyone to know more or less how to get from their home to other stops
on the traditional routes. Since the traditions rarely present any chronological information,
and indeed appear to take place in a single generation, this interpretation seems to be con-
sistent with a recent past.
While the idea of traveling to trade centers might well explain the basic structure of
tradition, the traditions might incorporate other material, for example in the praise name
that had greater or other historical significance. The praise name of the clan Mvemba, for ex-
ample, incorporates the widely known story that King Afonso I buried his mother alive, "for
the faith of the Savior King" (nkanka a Ntinu Nkangi).4 Another praise name links itself to
the seventeenth century history of the country by using Kongo's famous proverb involving
divisions into three by invoking the three fire stones "on which Kongo cooked" (makukwa
matatu malambidi Akongo) to remember the division of the royal family into three rival
branches, Kimpanzu, Kinlaza and Nkanga.35 This situation developed in the 1630s in the
successive reigns of Ivaro III (a Kimpanzu), Pedro II (a Nkanga) and AIvaro VI (a Kinlaza),
and whose descendents were all engaged in a sort of battle during the reign of Garcia II
(1641-61, but especially in 1656-7).36 The events were well enough remembered that they
were cited by Bernardo da Gallo in his 1710 description of Kongo's history, 80 years later.37
Thus, although I contended that Kongo's clan traditions were actually about events in
the recent past-Cuvelier's older informants might have been born in 1870 after all, when
the trade revolution was still building in intensity, there were fragments of much earlier
stories that survived. We know of the Afonso of tradition because of his own letters, and we
know that the story of his burying his mother alive was already in circulation in the 1680s.
We know of the three divisions in the Kongo royal family because of the survival of docu-
ments from the era which describe it in great detail.38 But of course, in both of these cases
the traditions are not of much help to historians. The documents remind us that Afonso
did not, in fact, bury his mother alive, and they tell us so much more than the three stones
proverb does about the faniily structure of the Kongo elite in the seventeenth century and
its contestations.39

MODERN ORAL TRADITION AND THE HISTORIC KINGDOM OF KONGO

But if these stories are not very helpful, there are others which might be much more
informative. One such story that the traditions can help us with is that of King Garcia IV. He
is one of Kongo's most obscure kings, who ruled from 1743 to 1752. There is no testimony
from documents about his reign or any of its circumstances. His name was only known to
posterity thanks to king lists written down in 1758 and 1844 that mentioned him and gave
the dates of his reign. The only historical fact they contain is that he was crowned by the
Vicar of Sdo Salvador, Panteldo das Neves Fronteira.40
But buried in one of Cuvelier's entries in Nkutama is a little chronicle associated with
the clan Nsimbi a Nimi a Nzinga near Mbanza Matari.4' It describes a series of rulers, each of
which was from the royal faction of Kinlaza, "Mfumu wavangidi luyala mu Mbanza Matadi"
or "the rulers who exercised rule at Matadi." First there was Dom Luvwalu (Alvaro) whose
"father was Nlaza" (se andi Nlaza). Curiously the tradition says he was "without a piece
of cloth from Europe, he wore cloth woven from palm leaves" (e ndele kianangama kuna
Mputu kialembwa etenda ). While the reference might just be hopelessly obscure, it is inter-
esting to note that the Antonian Movement insisted on the wearing of a special cloth woven
from the bark of the nsanda tree, as this was alleged to be the material in which the Baby
Jesus was swaddled. While Jodo II, ruler of Bula (which included Matadi) in the early eigh-
teenth century, had hastily thrown Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita out of his domains in 1705, his
enemies might well have become Antonians and chosen to wear this special cloth, at least for
the moment, as indeed, Beatriz was said to have thousands of followers when she went to
Bula to visit Jodo and demand his adherence to her cause.
Alvaro was followed by Don Galasia Nkoko a Mvika "child of Nlaza" (mwan'a Nlaza),
who for some reason was "a wanderer of the roads" (Nenge a nzila) and then by Don Galasa
Nkanga a Mvemba, another Kinlaza, who "went to the throne of Kongo" (Yandi wele mu
kiandu ku Kongo). This name, Garcia Nkanga a Mvemba, corresponds to some degree with
Garcia IV's name, "Ne Canga a Mibando," as given in the kinglist of 1758.42
Garcia's membership in the Kinlaza clan, and his residence in Matadi also give us
another small piece of information. We know that according to Cherubino da Savona, a
Capuchin missionary who was active in Kongo in the 1760s that Pedro IV, the restorer
of Sdo Salvador and the kingdom decreed that the kingship should rotate among the two
rival lineages of Kimpanzu and Kinlaza. We also know that the first successor of Pedro IV,
Manuel II Mpanzu a Nimi, was a Kimpanzu. This tradition tells us that the succession did
take place as envisioned by Pedro IV, for a Kinlaza did indeed follow the Kimpanzu ruler
on the throne. It carries additional weight, because we know that the Kinlaza branch that
controlled Matadi in Pedro IV's time were partisans of Pedro's deadly rival Jodo II.
In 1706, however, Jodo's court had split when the would-be king was incapacitated
by disease and effective rule passed to his sister Elena. Elena's conduct of the offIice alien-
ated a number of her followers, and as a result some of the nobles, including those around
Matadi, quit their allegiance to him (or her) and swore loyalty to Pedro IV.4 It seems likely

JOHN THORNTON

that in fact, it was from this group that Manuel II found his successor, one that had probably
supported him following Pedro IV's death and thus were favored with the succession. It is
tempting to suggest that perhaps the reason that Don Galasia Nkoko a Mvika, Garcia IV's
immediate predecessor, was said in tradition to wander the roads was because he was forced
to migrate during this period.
Another little tidbit adds something even more interesting to what tradition might tell
us about Garcia IV. This also comes from a chronicle sort of note, found in Cuvelier's note-
book, "Mvila XXII' and partially printed (with exactly one line missing) in Nkutama.44 It
describes a Don Galassa Mbundi a Nganga, not exactly a personal name but a title, meaning
roughly "master of priests" who struck an alliance between the Kimpanzu and the Kinlaza
(wabundidi Kimpanzu ye Kinlaza). Given the history of Garcia's succession, it seems quite
possible that the tradition refers to the arrangement that Pedro IV made and that in one or
another way Manuel II managed to concretize as an alliance between his own Kimpanzu
and this group of Kinlaza at least. The tradition then goes on to say "wa mbambi a sumika
ka isumunwa ko" or "those of Mbambi did not join in the alliance."'45 Here again there is
the possibility that "mbambi" simply refers to some local group whose history is otherwise
unknown, but if we were to read "mbambi" as "mbamba" it would suggest that people from
Mbamba province rejected the alliance.
An Mbamba rivalry is borne out by the historical facts. Though Manuel II came from
Mbamba Luvota, the home of the Kimpanzu in the late seventeenth century, the province
of Mbamba itself was hostile to them, and in the 1730s there was a major war in Mbamba
which devastated the province, for Anton Felice da Cortona mentioned it in 1733 and in
1734.46 Mbamba was certainly a pivotal province and one that might have swung for or
against whoever ruled in Sdo Salvador, especially if they were not Kimpanzu. In the 1780s,
for example, partisans of the former King Pedro V made a massive attack on Sdo Salvador to
dislodge the partisans of Jose I, a Kinlaza who had come to the throne in 1779.17
Virtually none of these traditions would be meaningful were it not for the documenta-
tion available to us from contemporary sources. But it is certainly worth noting that if my
speculations are correct, tradition used with the documents can illuminate events in Kongo
in ways that are not well illustrated in the documents. It is possible that a more careful study
of Nkutama or Cuvelier's notebooks will reveal other small chronicles with historical value.
Moreover, it is equally possible that having found an incident or event that is verifiable in
documents, the remaining portions of the tradition, for which there is no independent veri-
fication can contribute even fiuller knowledge to the study of Kongo history. The chronicle

"eyelids always lowered" perhaps a sign of "diminished spirit" or insanity.
I have always been a partisan of reading the documents carefully in Kongo history and
confess to skepticisms with regard to traditions. My skepticism is rooted in the fact that early

MODERN ORAL TRADITION AND THE HISTORIC KINGDOM OF KONGO

in my studies of Kongo history I could not find the links between what was found in tradi-
tions as I knew them in those days and what could be found in documents. But a deeper
study of those in Nkutama and its sources has made me less skeptical and thus more willing
to enter into their study.
I learned at least some of my skepticism from David Henige's example. His studies of
tradition, of the means of transmission of traditional knowledge, and of feedback in particu-
lar, have made me more critical of the blind following of tradition as if it were superior to the
written documents that characterized some of the historiography of the 1960s. On the other
hand, there is another side to tradition, which if viewed with a healthy amount of skepticism
and in the right context might still rescue some corners of history from obscurity.

1.  An earlier version of this paper was presented at the III Encontro sobre a hist6ria de Angola, Luanda,
September 30, 2007. Primary sources for this work include KADOC (Katolieke Documentation),

2.  Up to the present no documentation of local origin prior to the colonial period is known for the
region of Kongo. That archives existed, not only in the capital but also in the provinces is clear from
the accounts of travelers as recent as the mid nineteenth century, but no such archives have actually
come to light.

include sketch maps of routes, notes on the names and clans found in villages, detailed by-name lists
of village residents with clan affiliations, notes on travel and on places, and excerpts from traditions,
documents and the like. The works are written in Kikongo (primarily) with some elements in
French and Dutch. It is possible to date them roughly as they are often written on the back pages
of missionary stationary.
19. Cuvelier compiled a large quantity of documentation including many transcriptions of unpublished
materials, which he was able to use, and perhaps make available to other missionaries. Many of
these are found in his papers in KADOC 7.2 Cuvelier collection. One can obtain a good idea of the
range by checking the critical apparatus on his entries in Biographie coloniale belge (2 vols, Brussels:
Institut royal colonial belge, 1951).
20. I rely here on descriptions of such education sessions, explained to me in Mbanza Kongo on 28
September 2002 by Ant6nio Delfina Cuti, Luzolo Kiala, and Pedro Gabriel based on their personal
experience of doing this, and their assurances that the practice was widespread.

SHAKA'S MILITARY EXPEDITIONS: SURVIVAL AND MORTALITY FROM SHAKA'S IMPIS

Shaka's Military Expeditions: Survival
and Mortality from Shaka's Impis
ELIZABETH A. ELDREDGE, INDEPENDENT SCHOLAR
xtreme destruction, and images of rampant violence and countless deaths of war-
riors and civilians, have come to be associated with Shaka's deployment of izimpi
or "impis" in his military campaigns to extend and consolidate the rule of the
AmaZulu chiefdom across most of modern KwaZulu-Natal between 1817 and
1828. But just how destructive were Shaka's military expeditions? Contrary to common
assumptions, when Shaka deployed his troops on a campaign they did not always engage
in battle when they arrived at the scene of their intended attack, for chiefs and chiefdoms
sometimes submitted immediately without resistance, and sometimes took flight before the
arrival of Shaka's troops. Even when a battle did ensue, the levels of mortality from battle
were rarely high, and battles were usually fought away from civilian populations, so that
only rarely were there civilian deaths of women and children resulting from Shaka's military
campaigns. Verifiable instances in which there were high numbers of casualties and deaths,
and in which women and children were also victims, left a record of brutality and atrocities
associated with Shaka's troops. Surprisingly, however, the records of these battles indicate
that it was Shaka's troops themselves that often suffered the highest numbers of deaths on
campaign and in battle, rather than their intended targets. But the question remains as to
just how much depopulation actually resulted from Shaka's campaigns, and how many chief-
doms and people survived through strategies of submission or flight.'
Following the death of his father Senzangakona in 1816, Shaka had the heir killed and
usurped the AmaZulu chieftaincy. At this time the AmaZulu chiefdom was only one of many
in the region, and numbered no more than four thousand people, including a few minor
chiefdoms that had already come under Senzangakona's rule, so that the numbers of adult
men enrolled into AmaZulu military ranks numbered only in the hundreds. As Shaka used
these available troops to intimidate neighboring small chiefdoms into submitting to his rule,

he gained control over the ranks of their men of military age, and his regiments grew rapidly
in size and numbers. Within ten years the numbers of warriors under Shaka's command
had grown a hundred fold, from about five hundred men to over fifty thousand soldiers
mustered in some seventeen to twenty regiments of about three thousand men each. The
broader political dispensation changed dramatically over the course of Shaka's rule, before
his assassination in September 1828. In the era of his father's rule the AmaZulu chief owed
allegiance to and was a subordinate tributary chief to the AmaMthethwa chief Dingiswayo,
who had used military force as well as persuasion to consolidate many smaller chiefdoms in
the area. Other large chiefdoms of about the same size as the AmaMthethwa chiefdom, judg-
ing from their numbers of large villages and regiments, were those of the AmaNdwandwe,
the AmaHlubi, the AmaQwabe, the AmaNyuswa, and south of the Thukela River, the
AmaThuli and AmaCele. A chiefdom was defined in terms of its chief or inkosi, and was a
sociopolitical unit falling under the leadership and authority of the head of the ruling line of
descent for that chiefdom, whose adherents or subjects included members of numerous lines
of descent, i.e. clans or lineages, in addition to his own. The smallest chiefdoms were not
much larger than the members of known related members of an extended family, or lineage,
and might number-fewer than a hundred people, while the largest, including the populations
of their smaller subordinate tributary chiefdoms, numbered ten thousand or more. Shaka's
consolidation of rule over a wide territory meant that at the time of his death in 1828 the
subjects of the AmaZulu chieftaincy or kingdom included the people of virtually all of the
pre-existing chiefdoms, large and small, with a population that must have numbered well
over two hundred thousand people including adult men in regimental barracks scattered
across KwaZulu-Natal.
Tracing the chronology of all of Shaka's known military expeditions, this article ex-
amines evidence of the impis of Shaka's troops during his rule from 1817 to 1828 in order
to assess more closely levels of mortality from battles in which they engaged, in order to
provide a corrective to misleading and false assumptions about the degree of destruction
wreaked by Shaka's military expeditions, and to reconsider the extent of depopulation expe-
rienced in the region of KwaZulu-Natal. A consideration of the outcomes of Shaka's military
expeditions, whether or not they resulted in battle, and the numbers of slain, indicates there
was only limited depopulation in the region of KwaZulu-Natal as a result of military action,
and to a large extent only temporary depopulation occurred as a result of flight from battle
and temporary population displacement. This chapter explores levels of fighting associated
with the impis and mortality from each battle, and the outcome of each battle demographi-
cally and politically. Such in turn allows for an informed examination of the extent and role
of violence perpetrated by Shaka's impis in causing demographic changes and shaping the
sociopolitical dispensation in southeastern Africa in the era of Shaka's reign.2
For over a century historians accepted the attribution of a chain of regional wars and
migrations to destruction wrought by Shaka's troops, and used the term "mfecane" to refer

to this presumed process. Thus an estimate that more than a million people had died as a
result of Shaka's wars and their effects in the early nineteenth century was not challenged
until 1957, although a more accurate depiction of events had begun to emerge with the
publication by W.M MacMillan of Bantu, Boer, and Briton in 1929.1 Accepting that the
early decades of the nineteenth century were a period of demographic, social, and political
turmoil, recent scholars have sought alternative causes for those changes.4 In a speculative
theory, Julian Cobbing argued that slave-raiding and slave-trading by European missionaries
and British colonial officials operating across the northern and eastern Cape Colony fron-
tiers and from the area of Delagoa Bay had initiated this period of turmoil and sociopolitical
change. His argument was weakened by a lack of substantiating evidence, and in the end his
assumptions were shown to be false, as neither slave-raiders nor slave-traders operated out of
Delagoa Bay during the period in question, from the 1790s through the early 1820s. (Only
an insignificant number of slaves were exported beginning in 1825, long after the processes
of sociopolitical consolidation, including that of the AmaZulu kingdom under Shaka's rule,
had begun. )5
Furthermore, the evidence exonerates both missionaries and British colonial officials
from any involvement in slave-raiding across Cape Colony borders, although the agents of
Dutch-speaking settlers, notably renegade mixed-race Griqua and Kora groups of raiders,
did engage in taking human captives from across the northern frontier for trade and sale
within the colony.6 Instead, significant in explaining high rates of mortality was the presence
of famine, caused by frequent and prolonged droughts across the entire region between
1800 and the mid-1820s, demographic dislocations, raiding, and deliberate crop destruc-
tion.7 With few well-known notable exceptions among the engagements which will be re-
viewed below, mortality rates from battles in this period were generally far too low to ac-
count for any substantial depopulation.8 This article supports John Wright's conclusion that
the region south of the Thukela, later colonial Natal, was only indirectly controlled by Shaka
through subordinate allied chiefs, and that it experienced a period of political amalgamation
characterized by the incorporation of small chiefdoms that ceased to exist as independent
polities, rather than by extensive devastation and depopulation. Wright has not given suf-
ficient attention to the raiding and battles in the region, some of which were carried out by
Shaka's orders, but he is correct that "at no stage, as far as the evidence goes, did Zulu armies
make the murderous sweeps through the Natal area which conventionally they are supposed
to have done."9
The reconstruction of the history of the peoples of the region of modern KwaZulu-
Natal during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century rests of necessity on African
oral sources, because the earliest written sources are only available from European traders
who did not arrive for the exploration and settlement of Port Natal, later called Durban,
until 1824. Colin Webb and John Wright have meticulously translated the oral testimony
provided to James Stuart by over a hundred and fifty AmaZulu men, and a few women,

from the late 1890s through the early 1920s.'° The transcripts made by James Stuart are
self-evidently careful and usually were written down verbatim or in spontaneous translation
by Stuart who was himself fluent in the isiZulu language. The willingness of so many elderly
AmaZulu to confide their historical traditions to James Stuart, a South African-born colonial
magistrate, and his generous hospitality to them that was virtually unheard of for a white
South African in that era, speak to the mutual respect that governed the process of recording
this testimony. As Carolyn Hamilton has made clear, Stuart was not representative of a settler
mentality, but rather was driven by a genuine desire to advance the interests of the AmaZulu
people among whom he worked." The texts themselves reflect the care he took to record
accurately what he was told, since they contained many references which he did not under-
stand but nevertheless wrote down as told. Collectively they include contradictory accounts,
indicating there had been no process involving pressure towards conformity in the telling
or recording of these oral histories and traditions for any reasons. This variety in perspective
is reflected, for example, in Hamilton's study of the diverse portrayals of Shaka, which also
demonstrates that controversial information was retained even in the changing political dis-
pensations of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.'2 Besides reflecting a diversity of
information and attitudes, however, the interviews also include accounts that were retained
and transmitted independently from each other and therefore provide independent corrobo-
ration and confirmation of similar information retained in common. Jeff Peires' The House of
Phalo remains a model of how the history of this period can be reconstructed using oral and
written sources of African and European origin."
The European sources, even when their biases and political or trade agendas are obvi-
ous and distort their interpretations of events, when they can be independently corroborat-
ed, including by African oral sources, retain importance as documentary evidence of events
as they occurred. Most important for the issues addressed in this article are the writings
of Henry Francis Fynn, who was among a handful of white traders who opened a trading
post at Durban, then called Port Natal, in 1824, and had frequent dealings with Shaka at
his capital as well as with the AmaMpondo and Chief Faku among whom he conducted his
ivory trade.'4 The reliability of Fynn's writings varies but he was among the first to record
oral traditions told to him narrating events prior to his arrival that he had no reason to dis-
tort, and he was an eyewitness to many events for which there is corroborating independent
oral evidence. Also important, in spite of obvious distortions in its analysis, is an account
by Theophilus Shepstone, an early colonial administrator, a summation based on his own
interviews of several dozen elderly AmaZulu men.15
Shaka's Military Campaigns
When Shaka usurped the chieftaincy after his father Senzangakhona's death he remained a
subordinate chief to Dingiswayo as his father had been.'6 Within his first year of rule Shaka
joined Dingiswayo in mounting an attack against Matiwane that set the AmaNgwane into

flight from the Newcastle district where they had only been settled for a few years.17 Shaka
also mounted attacks on his own during this time. An important informant of Stuart's as-
serted that in the early years of Shaka's rule while Dingiswayo was still alive and Shaka's
AmaZulu were subject to AmaMthethwa rule, "[t]he Dube chief, Nzwakeli ka Kutshwayo,
had been defeated by Tshaka and had paid tribute, also Nqoboka of the Sokulu, [the
AmaCele chief] Magaye, and Zihlandhlo ka Gcwabe of the Embo."18 Shaka retained the
allegiance of the small chiefdoms that had already become subject to AmaZulu rule, such as
the AmaMpongose.'9 Then Shaka sent the AbaTembu under Chief Ngoza a formal warn-
ing, which suggests he expected to fight a formal battle between military regiments, and the
AbaTembu were routed in the attack after which they emigrated southwards.2° Passages
from the interviews by James Stuart indicate the ambiguous nature of the evidence about the
actual fighting in military conflicts and resulting mortality as remembered and related to later

generations. Although Lugubu first told Stuart that in the fight against the AmaZulu all of
the AbaTembu women and children were killed, he subsequently described the fate of the
women who escaped, thereby contradicting his own testimony about mortality in this battle
elsewhere in his interview. One interviewee provided evidence of a fight in which his father
had fought against the branch of the AbaTembu who had been living on the lower reaches
of the Mzinyathi when attacked by Shaka's troops at the Emzonganyati (up the Mngeni
River).2' He said,
The battle at the Emsonganyati. When the Zulus were in the water the abaTembu
hurled a shower of assegais at them. The Zulus merely held up their shields, made
their way across, and routed the enemy. My father was the first to stab there.22
Different branches of a chiefdom sometimes chose different responses to Shaka's demand
for allegiance and tribute. Some AmaMbata threw in their lot and migrated with Ngoza but
others stayed and khonza'd, i.e. gave their allegiance to Shaka, and their traditions relate
that they were then forbidden by Shaka to use their own praise-greeting or isithakazelo by
which they were known, "Ndabezita!," who took it for the AmaZulu and himself.23 Chief
Ngoza led his AbaTembu followers "into the Mpondo country" where they were decisively
defeated by the AmaMpondo of Chief Faku and Ngoza was killed in battle. After their
chiefs death many of Ngoza's AbaTembu followers returned to khonza Shaka, i.e. they for-
mally submitted to his rule. Shaka accepted their submission and allowed them to resettle
"among the Mandhiakazi.''25
The divergent fates of various branches of the chiefs identified (among themselves) as
AbaTembu because of common origins and retained sociopolitical links indicates the dif-
ficulty in interpreting evidence that seems suggestive that many people were killed or died
in warfare, when it may refer only to a small number of people or even an individual chief,
rather than all of his adherents who may have survived by giving their allegiance to another
chief such as Shaka. Thus one of Stuart's informants stated flatly but mistakenly that "there
are no more Tembus left; they were killed by the Zulus in Tshaka's day."'26 His testimony
referred specifically only to chief Mangete and some of his followers who had gone into hid-
ing in the bushes; they were slowly killed off by bandits who roved the area, killed people
and took the food from their cultivated gardens. However this interviewee also testified
that some of chief Mangete's adherents had "run off to Pondoland" and only those who
remained behind in the Natal region with Mangete were killed off over time.
Shaka sent regiments against Macingwane's AmaCunu at the same time as the expedi-
tion against Ngoza because these chiefs were planning coordinated resistance against Shaka,
and because they had attacked the AmaCube and had killed their chief Mvakela, an ally and
subordinate of Shaka's.27 Shaka's troops defeated Macingwane's soldiers in a forest fight
where they are reported to have killed women and children before they seized the cattle.
Macingwane himself escaped and fled south to the AmaMpondo in the wake of Ngoza's
AbaTembu migration. His fate remained unknown, but many AmaCunu returned under

Mfosi to tender allegiance to Shaka. Over time they re-established themselves as a subordi-
nate chiefdom under the heir Pakade, a contemporary of Shaka's, who had taken temporary
refuge with the Embo (AbaMbo or Mkhize) chief Zihlandlo.28
After these larger, more powerful chiefs had emigrated with their followers Shaka pro-
ceeded to attack or threaten into submission the smaller chiefdoms in the area of the White
and Black Mfolozi rivers nearby the KwaZulu ancestral home, including the AmaMpanza,
AmaButhelezi of Pungatshe (who according to some sources did not fight or put up any
resistance), the AmaPisi, and others.29 At this time Shaka also sent his troops twice to attack
his cousin Makedama, now chief of the AmaLanga at eLangeni, but the AmaZulu troops
were forced to retreat without any cattle. A third time Shaka coordinated an attack with the
AbaQwabe and the AmaNyuswa, and Makedama held out in a fortress and then returned
to his land. Just after, however, he left with his followers to khonza the AmaNdwandwe
chief Zwide, only to return not long after with his followers to submit to Shaka and re-
settle in their original home next to the ancestral home of the AmaZulu.° Evidence from
the oral traditions thus appear to disagree with Fynn's statement that the people of "the
Langeni tribe," Shaka's mother's chiefdom, "freely submitted in the expectation of receiving
favourable treatment," but this is explained by the deep divisions within the AmaLangeni,
some having remained with Shaka throughout the duration of his years with Dingiswayo
among the AmaMthethwa, because they had originally left eLangeni to contest the rule of
Makedama who had usurped the chieftaincy violently (and who became the target of Shaka's
attacks),31
The subordination of the AbaQwabe chiefdom under Pakatwayo became Shaka's next
goal, and according to most oral traditions he achieved their involuntary conquest with
virtually no fighting.32 Taken by surprise, the AbaQwabe were unarmed when they were
surrounded by Shaka's warriors and did not attempt any further resistance after their chief
Pakatwayo was immediately captured. Most traditions agree that Pakatwayo was not killed
by Shaka or any of his men but only died the next day "of fear" while he was in the cus-
tody of Shaka's warriors in his own village.33 Some AbaQwabe khonza'd Shaka, but others
khonza'd his superior Dingiswayo, dating these events to prior to Dingiswayo's own death
in about 1818. Some AbaQwabe also reportedly khonza'd Zwide and the AmaNdwandwe,
of whom some then returned to khonza Shaka shortly thereafter.34
During the early period of AmaZulu expansion while still under Dingiswayo's au-
thority, Dingiswayo reportedly sent Shaka to settle with force a conffict between Sirayo
and Mgabi ka Mapoloba, brothers, and allowed Shaka to attack the AmaNyuswa (abak-
waNyusa).3s After defeating the AbaQwabe and incorporating many of them, Shaka attacked
chiefs Mahlungwana (of the AmaBele, i.e. AmaNtuli), Mzilikazi (of the AmaKhumalo),
Dube (of the AmaQadi), Pungatshe (of the Buthelezi), and Donda (of the AmaKhumalo).36
Fyun wrote that after defeating Mahiungwana, "many of the LAmaBele] tribe gave their
allegiance.''s This sequence of Shaka's attacks was related with certainty by Stuart' s in-

formant Jantshi ka Nongila in 1903, who said that after achieving the submission of the
AmaBele under chief Mahlungwana, Shaka next attacked the AmaKhumalo chief Mzilikazi
ka Matshobana. Following this he launched a military campaign against Chief Dube and
the AmaQadi (a branch of the AmaNgcobo) and, significantly, "[h]ere too there had been
no quarrel. He defeated Dube. This tribe did not flee but paid taxes and Tshaka seized
a number of their cattle." The depiction is important in recording an impi that yielded
political results and the seizure of cattle as booty. The story relates what was evidently an
accepted practice of the subordination of one chief and chiefdom by another, resulting in a
tributary, or tax-paying, relationship. Jantshi reports that Tshaka "now engaged Pungatshe
of the Butelezi and defeated him" without further detail, and then defeated Donda, like
Mzilikazi the chief of one of possibly three AmaKhumalo chiefdoms, and confiscated his
cattle ("Tshaka defeated him [Donda] and ate up his cattle"), but there is no mention of
violent fighting or killing.38
In 1817 or 1818, the AmaMthethwa chief Dingiswayo was captured and killed by
Chief Zwide of the AmaNdwandwe, and Shaka, incensed at the killing of Dingiswayo, sent
his troops to attack Zwide. In this "great battle," however, the AmaZulu did not defeat
the AmaNdwandwe. Far from having played any part in Dingiswayo's downfall, Shaka
is portrayed by AmaZulu narrators as having sought revenge against Zwide on behalf of
Dingiswayo, and he planned a night attack towards that end. Rather than face Zwide's
troops in battle, Shaka's troops followed his orders and attacked by surprise at night, using
a password to avoid killing each other by mistake as Zwide's troops awoke and fought. The
AmaZulu retreated into a forest the next day, only to return for a second night attack, in
which they "once more stabbed Zwide's people a good deal" but were in the end unable to
defeat them. It appears that Shaka did not accompany the troops, as they did not report to
him until after they once again retreated.39
Shaka's troops then forced the submission of the remnant AmaMthethwa who after
their chief Dingiswayo's death were unable to put up any resistance to their incorporation
in a subordinate status by the AmaZulu. Although Fynn reported that upon incorporat-
ing the AmaMthetwa many were killed, it appears rather that the chiefdom was dispersed
and many of those who khonza'd Shaka reoccupied their old village sites, and others are
said to have emigrated under one of Dingiswayo's sons and given their allegiance to the
AmaNdwandwe chief Soshangane.4° In the initial process of dispersing and consolidating
the AmaMthethwa, who had previously given refuge to himself and villages of his maternal
relatives, Shaka does not appear to have killed any AmaMthethwa, contrary to Fynn's as-
sertion. Oral traditions agree, however, that in response to a deliberate provocation Shaka
later killed the AmaMthethwa chieftaincy's heir Mondisa and others of his followers.4' Some
prominent AmaMthethwa left when they began to realize their safety was insecure under
Shaka. According to one narrative of events,

SHAKA'S MILITARY EXPEDITIONS: SURVIVAL AND MORTALITY FROM SHAKA'S IMPIS
Nxaba ka Mbekane ka Msane of, I think, the Mtetwa people, ran off, like Matiwana,
Mzilikazi, Sotshangana, and Somveli [father of Sitimela, says Ndukwana] ka
Dingiswayo. Nxaba was driven out by Tshaka. Somvei also left. This arose when
they were in the cattle enclosure at Bulawayo; they were jesting with one another.42
Thus the exodus of some chiefs with their followers occurred without any further
violence or mortality, for after meeting with Shaka, Somveli "returned home, only to arm
and leave for the north on the ground that he and Tshaka had quarreled," although "[a]s a
matter of fact Tshaka had not driven him away.... ,,41
After Shaka's first attack against Zwide immediately following the death of Dingiswayo,
Shaka next attacked Mapoloba ka Mbele, chief of the AmaNyuswa (whom he had previously
attacked) and "defeated him and seized his cattle."44 The AmaNyuswa, a branch of the
AmaNgcobo, formerly a strong chiefdom during the reign of Senzangakhona, became sub-
jects of Shaka. Shaka fought against and killed Chief Kondhlo ka Magalela of the AmaNtshali
(not to be confused with Chief Kondhlo of the AmaQwabe). His followers fled and then
returned to attack Shaka under direction of Kondhlo's son Nkubu, but suffered defeat in
battle. When Shaka attacked the AmaCele under their chief ("king") Mande ka Dibandhlela,
and Zihlandhlo ka Gcwabe, the Embo chief, he "did not kill but merely caught them." Thus
referring to the chiefs of larger chiefdoms as "kings," Stuart's informant Jantshi continued,
"[a]part from the above battles and conquests, Tshaka attacked many other so-called kings
that I cannot now call to mind."'45 Having said that he mentioned a few other conquered
chiefs: Duzi, chief of the Makanya, who was not killed by Shaka but was promoted and made
an induna (officer); Mbenya, also not put to death; and Kutshwayo, chief of the Dube, also
not killed. Emphasizing that these conquered chiefs were not put to death, Jantshi explained
significantly, "[a]s a matter of fact, Tshaka did not put to death the kings or kinglets he de-
feated if, when he proceeded against them, they ran away and did not show fight. He made
them izinduna. Kutshwayo, chief of the Dube, is another of those conquered by Tshaka.
This man, like many others, was attacked merely to make him pay tribute, i.e. reduce him
to become a subject and then instate him as an induna."'46 Jantshi added that Soshangana
was also attacked by Shaka, and "[t]he only king who was not attacked by Tshaka was
Mtshwetshwe [Moshoeshoe] of Basutoland. He, hearing Tshaka was so powerful, payed
[sic] tribute with elephant tusks and acknowledged allegiance."'47
In 1821 the AmaHlubi chiefdom, after been attacked by the AmaNgwane ofMatiwane,
broke up and many migrated west across the Drakensberg mountains under several sepa-
rate chiefs, to be followed soon after by the AmaNgwane. The fragmenting of the formerly
dominant AmaHlubi chiefdom into smaller chiefdoms under several of chiefs signaled the
process that was referred to colloquially as izwekufa, literally the "death of nations." 48 Many
prominent AmaHiubi including members of the royal family khonza'd Shaka, submitting to
his rule and giving him their allegiance, and he formed them into the Iziyendane regiment
stationed at the village of his mother Nandi not far from the AmaZulu capital at Bulawayo.49

ELIZABETH A. ELDREDGE

After the defeat and death of Pakatwayo, Shaka sent troops south of the Thukela to
attack the AbaQwabe living south of the river, and the AmaCele chief Magaye there volun-
tarily became a tributary subordinate ally to Shaka by giving him his allegiance and offering
no resistance to the AmaZulu extension of authority into the region of modern Natal.50
Following Dingiwayo's death and the incorporation of the AmaMthethwa, Shaka sent his
cousin Makedama to attack the AmaThuli chiefdom of Ntaba ka Nyebu and other chief-
doms in the Natal region including the AmaCele of Mande ka Dibandhlela. Under Shaka's
orders Makedama's troops, aided by the AmaCele chief Magaye who had remained loyal to
Shaka, attacked the AmaThuli, other AmaCele, and various other chiefdoms."' In various
attacks, the chiefs of the region of Natal were defeated quickly, and in cases where they did
not khonza Shaka, they were put to death.
Before Tshaka fought with the Ndwandwe he entered Natal and attacked Mande
ka Dibandhlela of the Cele people and Duze ka Mnengwa of the Makanya people,
killing each the same night. He at the same time killed Sokoti ka Mdindi of the
Amanganga people, Nduna ka Mbedu ka Gwayi ka Nyapase of the emaSomeni peo-
ple, Mtimkulu ka Dibandhlela of the Mapumulo people, and Nzala ka Mangqatshu
of the emaNdhlovini people who built at Esidumbini, at the Ivutwaneni stream
which enters the Nsuze which enters the Mvoti.s2
After these disruptive raids Shaka sent a large contingent of the Iziyendane (AmaHlubi)
regiment accompanied by some AmaMthethwa regiments to settle in the region of modern
Natal and from their new villages there they attacked and raided even further to the south.53
The AmaHlubi Iziyendane regiment played a destructive role in the region.
After this Tshaka collected together forces of these various tribes and attacked fur-
ther south in Natal with them. But he first of all made a colony of Natal by sending
the Iziyendane, as well as some Mtetwa people, to live in the neighbourhood of the
Mvoti. The Iziyendane were of the amaHlubi tribe. The Hlubis had previously run
away from Matiwana (Zwide) [sic] and konza'd the Zulus. The Zulus did not fight
with the Hlubis.14
This use of the term "colony" in this oral tradition with reference to Shaka's establish-
ment of subordinate allies in Natal was explicit and was meant to indicate a resettlement that
displaced the existing population, who remained subject to predatory raids if they stayed
in the area. As a result, most took flight to resettle among the AmaMpondo. Because the
troops of the Iziyendane, AmaMthethwa, AmaNganga, and AmaPumalo were deployed by
Shaka to attack and subordinate the small chiefdoms of modern Natal they were perceived
to be AmaZulu by the victims of their raids in the south, in spite of the distinct identities
they retained as military units.55 Maziyana explained the perspective of the people of these
displaced chiefdoms, a perspective that they conveyed to the AmaMpondo in turn:
The Iziyendane, Mtetwa, amaNganga, amaPumulo etc. were those who attacked
the tribes south. They adopted a Zulu chant, and if any stranger should hear them
chanting thus he would dash off and jump into a swamp or other hiding place.

SHAKA'S MILITARY EXPEDITIONS: SURVIVAL AND MORTALITY FROM SHAKA'S IMPIS
These men therefore were transformed into Zulus and were regarded as such by the
tribes south. When Tshaka came back from eNsikeni he, on hearing from Magaye
that the Iziyendane retained possession of the cattle they had seized from the Natal
tribes, attacked the Iziyendane themselves and caused them to flee away south to
the Nguni country. Others went off to the Sutu country, to Basutos.
It was the Iziyendane and the others mentioned that attacked along the Natal
coast as far as the Mzimkulu--on Tshaka's behalf-and scattered all the tribes. They
are the ones who, without special instructions, caused people to flee in the way re-
ferred to by Fynn, who in July 1824 found only a few kraals of Tulis on the Bluff.56
This passage indicates that the warriors of the AmaHlubi, AmaMthethwa, AmaNganga,
AmaPumalo, and others had been allowed not only to live but also to continue serving as
soldiers following their submission and offer of allegiance to Shaka. However, Shaka did not
intend to allow the independence of the subordinate regiments he had sent into Natal to
grow, even though he let them build villages there with the implication that their relocation
was permanent. On the contrary, he expected that they signify their continued submission
to him by sending him all of the booty in cattle they accumulated in any raids, which they
did not do. The presumptive behavior of the Iziyendane, AmaMthethwa, and others who
had resettled in Natal was to keep the cattle they seized there, provoking a military campaign
against them by Shaka.
Shaka therefore depended on the AmaCele chief Magaye's loyalty, and permitted him
the latitude to enroll his own military regiments and conduct raids for cattle in Natal, as a
tributary subordinate chief to the AmaZulu. Shaka initially provided Magaye with cattle to
raise a new regiment, although he took one of Magaye's best regiments from him and made
them into one of his own regiments. The evidence about the activities of the AmaCele under
Chief Magaye provide insight not only with regard to Tshaka's modus operandi with regard
to subordinate chiefs who khonza'd him, but also as evidence that some "impis" were merely
cattle raids and did not result in death or destruction of villages:
The Rodi [AmaCele] regiment was formed with cattle from Tshaka. Tshaka said to
Magaye, 'I shall give you an impi so that you can make war.' When Tshaka began to
destroy the country he went as far as the Mkomazi. He then went home, and it was
then that he, Tshaka, spoke of giving Magaye an impi so that he could make war.
Tshaka gave him an impi and he, Magaye, attacked across the Mkomazi [Inkomati
River]. Magaye then 'ate up' [confiscated] the cattle of the country of Ngoyi ka
Nomakwelo of the amaMbili tribe. When Magaye returned with the captured cat-
tle, then the uRodi kraal [village] formed and became his regiment.17
Following his successful raiding in the Natal region, Makedama was also killed by an
impi sent by Shaka on a weak pretext because he had been so successful as to have become a
threat. Some traditions relate that he had taken decisions that were the prerogative of Shaka
and therefore implied a renunciation of his subordinate statuss8 These raids and population
dislocations account for the relative depopulation of the area and the extreme poverty and

fear of the residual population encountered by Fynn in when he first traveled through the
area between Port Natal and Faku's territory in 1824.
Shaka fought more than one battle against Chief Zwide and the AmaNdwandwe after
Dingiswayo's death. After being unable to defeat the AmaNdwandwe after Dingiswayo's
death in about 1818, Shaka soon found it necessary to withdraw all of his AmaZulu troops
southwards to avoid an attack by an overwhelming AmaNdwandwe force, and AmaZulu
towns were destroyed and burned by the invaders. Shaka carefully prepared for their next
inevitable military encounter, however. He developed and employed a new strategy that
involved luring Zwide's troops, the next time they came, deeper into AmaZulu territory to
exhaust and starve them and thereby weaken them before he launched a counterattack at
a place of his own choosing. This plan succeeded in the second invasion and attack by the
AmaNdwandwe in 1821, and the AmaZulu troops routed those of Zwide and drove them
all the way home.9
The oral traditions indicate widely divergent fates for the AmaNdwandwe who were
counter-attacked and chased into their own territory by Shaka's troops in 1821.
The Ndwandwe appeared on the Nkandhla heights, following in the track of
Tshaka's impi. When he got to Nomveve, Tshaka hid his impi. In the afternoon the
armies made contact through their spies. He unleashed his warriors. At dawn the
next day he set them on with the Siklebe regiment in front. He was sitting close
by, looking on. He was looking on at his warriors stabbing the men. He said, 'Stop
throwing your assegais [spears]. Stab them at close quarters. Use only one assegai.'
His impi defeated them and drove them up into the hills at the Mhlatuze. That was
the day when his army finally defeated them.60
Following the battle, "Tshaka defeated Zwide, followed him up and seized all his corn.
Zwide was completely routed. Large numbers of Zulus poured into Zwide's dominions and
took all they could find."'61 The fate of Zwide's soldiers depended on whether they fought
or surrendered their arms to the AmaZulu warriors:
They said, 'Lay down your shield' to each man. Those who refused to throw down
their shields were stabbed. Those who obeyed were collected into Tshaka's army;
those who resisted were killed.62
Shaka's impi proceeded to Zwide's place, and Zwide escaped, but the women, think-
ing it was their own troops, came out with food: "They were stabbed; they were killed; the
food was thrown down. The army went on and surrounded Zwide's umuzi [homestead],
but he had escaped. They impaled the children on posts; they stabbed the women; they
stabbed everything at his home."163 It is significant that this is the only oral tradition that
asserts that any of Shaka's warriors impaled civilians on any occasion. With reference to
this AmaZulu attack and defeat of Zwide, the source sounds credible, but the impaling of
children and killing of women on this occasion may have been the fate only of Zwide's own
family members as the reference is to the attack on his capital, and it is known that many
AmaNdwandwe women survived this military defeat. However, at Zwide's village, "Coma,

i.e. buxeka, spike on posts. Only bigger children were impaled, not infants. The mothers of
the latter were killed and the infant left alive at their side, i.e. laid down alive beside her."
Stuart's informant Nduna explained, "Tshaka insisted on women being killed, as an army
would again rise in that country. Women that bear warriors must exist in Zululand only.64
After the 1821 battle and rout the majority of the AmaNdwandwe, including women
and children as well as warriors, took flight and migrated as a chiefdom that now fragmented
under several senior chiefs, some of whom migrated into southern Mozambique. Zwide
appears to have remained with Soshangane while his senior son Sikhunyana led his own
portion of the chiefdom into the Transvaal territory and resettled near where Mzilikazi's
AmaKhumalo or AmaNdebele chiefdom also relocated. The AmaZulu troops did not pur-
sue these migrant AmaNdwandwe chiefs and their followers very far, but chose instead to
round up all of their cattle that in flight they were forced to leave behind. 6' From his numer-
ous informants, Shepstone also learned of these events from interviews he conducted in the
1840s, and he concluded from what he was told that although "Chaka promptly followed
upon his advantage and compelled him [Zwide] and a portion of his people to fly his coun-
try; the great majority of Zwide's people then submitted to Chaka and became Zulu sub-
jects, and the last serious check upon Chaka's victorious career was then removed."'66 This
is an important account in that it states that Shaka did not kill all or even most of Zwide's
AmaNdwandwe followers, nor did they all flee, but some, perhaps even "the great major-
ity" of Zwide's AmaNdwandwe, khonza'd Shaka after he defeated them and their chief fled.
Zwide himself lived for three more years before he finally died of illness.67
After Zwide's defeat, the later famous AmaKhumalo chief Mzilikazi came into con-
flict with Shaka, to whom he had previously tendered his submission and allegiance. As his
tributary Mzilikazi had been ordered by Shaka to attack chief Maconi of the AmaNtshingila,
put him to death, and seize his cattle. After fulfilling these orders Mzilikazi declined to give
up the booty in cattle to Shaka, however. Instead, apparently after a battle with Shaka's
troops, in which many of Mzllikazi's followers were said to have been killed and many
cattle lost, Mzilikazi withdrew with his followers to avoid Shaka's impis who were sure to
pursue them.68 Mzilikazi led his AmaKhumalo followers north to reestablish a "migrant
kingdom" or chiefdom in the Transvaal region, beyond Shaka's easy reach.69 Mzilikazi's
new AmaNdebele kingdom was subsequently attacked twice in major AmaZulu military
campaigns sent to the Transvaal during Dingane's reign.7
Chiefdoms in the region of modern KwaZulu north of the Thukela river sometimes
fought among themselves without Shaka's involvement, but subsequently themselves drew
an attack from Shaka. Chief Mnguni of the AmaNgidi people signaled his disavowal of
Shaka's authority by refusing to attend a ceremonial dance with his unarmed warriors. Soon
afterwards Mnguni and the AmaNgidi were attacked by two other small chiefs, Bovungana
ka Mvela of the AmaNgcobe and Kabezele ka Mavovo of the Abasembo (Embo). Mnguni's
warriors caught both chiefs and killed the latter, thereby defeating their attackers. However,

ELIZABETH A. ELDREDGE

their very success demonstrated that they were strong enough to pose a real threat to Shaka
whom Chief Mnguni had already provoked symbolically, and Shaka sent his army to attack
the AmaNgidi. A direct descendant of the original ancestor named Ngidi had been told that
on Shaka's orders when Mnguni's son was killed in battle his head was cut off and sent to
Shaka, and he reported that Mnguni's regiments fought two fierce battles. The first lasted
four days as Mnguni's warriors struggled to divert Shaka's troops and provide time for the
villagers, including the women and children, to retreat to safety with their cattle. The Nsuze
and Mhlatuze Rivers, site of the first battle, and Hlobane mountain, site of the second,
were said to have become red with blood from the fighting, but none of Mnguni's war-
riors ran from battle, and they secured the future of their chiefdom which migrated as far as
the Orange River to resettle safely there and did not have to fight against Shaka's warriors
again71
The AmaMbomvu fought against AmaZulu troops at oPisweni mountain where they
were defeated in a surprise night attack against their mountain stronghold, and their cattle
and women were said to have been captured.72 Using ladders to scale the cliffs that protected
the villagers and cattle, Shaka's warriors are said to have released the cattle through the gate,
while the men who were taken by surprise "tumbled over the cliffs" so that "there was no
actual fighting."'73 The AmaBomvu, most of whom survived although their chief was killed,
remained in their own territory but under AmaZulu rule.
Shaka's attention was drawn to the southwest as he acquired more knowledge about
Faku's AmaMpondo chiefdom, and the chiefdoms of the AmaXhosa beyond him. Thus
those chiefdoms that had fled to resettle in the modern region of Natal and further south-
west in the territory of the AmaMpondo of Chief Faku soon found they were not safe from
Shaka's army. Shaka had begun to fear the strength of the AmaXhosa chief Hintsa.74 Chief
Madikane had led his AmaBaca followers in a migration as a chiefdom from Emkambatini
(Table Mountain) near modern Pietermaritzburg to resettle in AmaMpondo territory. This
provided Shaka with a pretext to send a military campaign there, Shaka's 1824 amabece
impi that was putatively sent to "fetch" Madikane, i.e. enforce his submission and seize his
cattle as tribute.75 Shaka instead used this first military campaign against the AmaMpondo
to seize their cattle and spread word that as tributaries to him they would not be attacked,
and conflicting oral traditions seem to agree that Shaka's ultimate goal for this campaign was
to gather information about the AmaXhosa chiefs residing beyond Faku's territory. Taken
together the evidence suggests that Shaka's regiments passed unchallenged until, pursuing
Madikane's AmaBaca, they found themselves deep in AmaMpondo territory and bordering
that of the AmaXhosa chief Hintsa, where these AmaZulu regiments were attacked and lost
three units (amabandhla) and faced starvation. The defeated but surviving AmaZulu regi-
ments had to rely on eating amabece melons for food to survive, from which the campaign
came to be called the amabece campaign. Nevertheless Shaka's impi returned home with

SHAKA'S MILITARY EXPEDITIONS: SURVIVAL AND MORTALITY FROM SHAKA'S IMPIS
AmaMpondo cattle they had seized as their booty, and with the information they had gath-
ered en route.76
Evidence from the oral traditions regarding the level of fighting that occurred dur-
ing the amabece campaign is contradictory. The sources agree that the AmaZulu engaged
in fighting and suffered heavy losses before successfully seizing and carrying off many
AmaMpondo cattle, but there is some confusion about whether they had first reached the
territory of Hintsa. One source referred to the amabece campaign as a campaign against
"abeNguni" rather than AmaMpondo, and another said, "the amabece impi went forth first.
It attacked [AmaXhosa chief] Hinsa. The amabece [melons] were eaten when there was no
other food to eat. They were eaten uncooked, in Pondoland and beyond. My father went
with both these impis."77 Another source agreed that Hintsa had been the target of the impi,
and explained, "Tshaka first sent an impi to Hinsa, as it was said he had an ibuto so large that
it would take all day rising. This regiment was known as the Inkonyane of Hinsa." However,
"Tshaka's forces went, failed to find Hinsa, and came on European houses. Mdhlaka turned
back as there were no instructions to attack Europeans, and in turning, discovered some of
Faku's cattle, which the Zulus seized.''78 Another of Stuart's interviewees explained that the
troops had traveled an inland route in trying to find Madikane and the AmaBaca, but upon
failing to find them turned into AmaMpondo territory. As they were raiding some of Faku's
herds, "the Pondos came to the attack," and
On the 'amabece' campaign the Zulu were cut up by the Mpondo, for three Zulu
units (amabandhla) were finished off. But the Zulu got the better of them and
succeeded in seizing some of their cattle, but not many. Tshaka did not accompany
this impi. This force got to the end of their cattle (meat supply) and suffered from
hunger. They were obliged to eat melons (amabece) and wild plants.79
After the amabece campaign of early 1824, Shaka sent a campaign against Zwide's
residual AmaNdwandwe chiefdom in mid-1824, and in this campaign several villages were
said to have been "destroyed" although the fate of the villagers is unknown and common-
ly they would have fled.80 Zwide died in late 1824 or early 1825 and word was received
by Shaka that Sikhunyana, his son, had become chief of that branch of the now divided
AmaNdwandwe who had nevertheless recovered much of their strength since their defeat
by Shaka in 1821.81
In May 1826, having heard that Sikhunyana and his AmaNdwandwe followers were
north of the Phongolo River with plans to attack the AmaZulu, Shaka mounted a preemp-
tive military campaign and moved to launch a surprise attack against them.82 Shaka com-
pelled several of the European traders, including Fynn, to accompany this impi, so that more
than one eyewitness account from a European has survived. Fynn wrote that the AmaZulu
military regiments were accompanied by thousands of boys, aged six to twelve years old,
and girls, who served as carriers for all of the supplies and food needed by the warriors,
so that he estimated the expedition numbered a total of fifty thousand people proceeding

northwards for several days and camping out at night.83 When they finally encountered the
AmaNdwandwe north of the Phongolo River a major battle was engaged involving tens
of thousands of warriors arranged in formal regiments on both sides. As Shaka, Fynn and
others observed from mountain overlooks, the AmaNdwandwe women, children and cattle
were ensconced and surrounded by warriors on another mountain. Fynn estimated the total
AmaNdwandwe population there at forty thousand or more; their warriors were not able
to withstand the AmaZulu regiments in the hand-to-hand fighting that ensued.84 An esti-
mated sixty thousand cattle were captured, and Fynn wrote that the women and children
were all put to death.85 The AmaZulu had struck preemptively in a surprise move against the
AmaNdwandwe, accounting for the vulnerability of AmaNdwandwe women and children
who would have been safely secured away from the battle had Sikhunyana's warriors suc-
ceeded in mounting their planned attack in AmaZulu territory several day's journey to the
south.
Shaka had come to eliminate this threat and he is said to have issued an order to "kill
off any soul, woman, and child" because "he wanted nothing of Sikhunyana's to survive."'86
Sikhunyana, however, escaped, and the evidence about the fate of his followers is ambigu-
ous. Since it was reported that cattle, but not women and children, were seized by the
AmaZulu troops, Fynn and other European witnesses (none of whom participated) may
have mistakenly assumed that all of the women and children were killed. European witnesses
said that the AmaNdwandwe women stepped forward to fill the ranks of the men and fight,
thus providing an explanation for why women were killed in the battle. These witnesses
also reported a total AmaNdwandwe mortality of three thousand men and women killed
(combined, including warriors).87 A staggering number relative to other battles, this was
nevertheless far short of the total population of forty thousand estimated by Fynn, and it ap-
pears the vast majority of these AmaNdwandwe did manage to escape death as the AmaZulu
turned their attention instead to gathering the herds of cattle as darkness fell. That most
AmaNdwandwe survived this terrible battle is self-evident in that after Sikhunyana's death
several other of Zwide's sons and their followers returned to give their allegiance to Shaka,
and after they came to khonza the younger men were enrolled in the AmaZulu regiments
both during Shaka's reign and during the rule of Dingane and then Mpande.88
After this 1826 victory Shaka sent troops against two chiefs who had been tributary to
the AmaNdwandwe. Mlotshwa held out briefly and then surrendered and gave his allegiance
to Shaka, but Chief Beje's people resisted, and when Shaka was forced to send another impi
against them he compelled several Europeans to join the regiments.89 Three Europeans and
a small party of their Khoi servants, thus coerced by Shaka to fight for him, met up with the
AmaZulu regiments that had been stationed surrounding the AmaBeje for months without
attacking them. An attempt to raid the AmaBeje cattle provoked a confrontation, but the
AmaBele chief was immediately killed, and the AmaBeje surrendered without further fight-
ing, so there were only a few casualties and apparently only two dead (one being the chief. )9°

SHAKA'S MILITARY EXPEDITIONS: SURVIVAL AND MORTALITY FROM SHAKA'S IMPIS
Violence in the region persisted because the powerful Embo (Mkhize) chief Zihlandlo, hav-
ing assisted Shaka in the major 1826 battle against the AmaNdwandwe, retained his rela-
tive independence and subsequently raided some additional twenty small chiefdoms, seizing
their cattle and sometimes killing their chiefs. Finally Shaka's AmaZulu regiments attacked
Zihlandlo, although a putative subordinate ally, and drove him off to the south of modern
Natal.9'
Next, Shaka's half-brother (and successor) Dingane led an AmaZulu military expedi-
tion in 1827 into Lesotho and the Caledon River area, perhaps without authorization from
Shaka. Dingane's expedition fought a major battle against the AmaNgwane at Ladybrand,
as independent oral traditions from the AmaZulu, AmaNgwane, and BaSotho confirm. The
AmaZulu oral traditions say little about this battle, probably because it was not authorized
by Shaka, that is, ceremonies seeking ancestral approval and assistance were not held by
Shaka. But the campaign is remembered by name as the eyobutshinga impi and identified
as that which went to raid the AmaNgwane; the officers who commanded the troops were
remembered by name as well, with reference to the regiment under their command.92 The
BaSotho oral traditions remember these events also with reference to the names of those
known to have been killed, including the prominent wives of several chiefs. Their traditions
agree with those of the AmaZulu that Dingane was among those who led the impi and sug-
gest that it had been initiated in response to a message sent to Shaka by the rising chief of
the emerging BaSotho kingdom, Moshoeshoe.9'
Shaka's regiments appear to have crossed the Drakensberg at the end of 1826, and
engaged in one of their first attacks at Clocolan in February 1827.94 The primary goal ap-
pears to have been to raid for cattle, but in at least one battle civilians were said to have been
put to death in an attack against a village. Some oral traditions claimed that an AmaZulu
regiment crossed to south of the Orange River before turning back to continue their attack
and raid against Matiwane's AmaNgwane.9' The locations and participants in the ensuing
fights along the Caledon River valley were remembered by the AmaNgwane, who watched
their cattle being swept away by the AmaZulu regiments.96 Perhaps because one of the oral
traditions originated from an eyewitness participant, an UmNgwane warrior, a major battle
near Ladybrand involving several regiments from both sides facing off against each other is
among the best documented of the conflicts that were fought in this AmaZulu military cam-
paign. The same eyewitness also reported that Dingane was wounded in battle, stabbed in
the chest with an assegai (spear) which might account for the suppression of later AmaZulu
accounts of these events.97 He also provided evidence of the high mortality suffered in the
Ladybrand battle, for "[m]any warriors of both sides fell on that day, and, for years af-
terwards, the Basuto used to pick up fragments of weapons among little piles of human
bones.''98 This was one of only two fights in the region of Lesotho during the 1820s said to
have resulted in mortality figures that were counted in "the hundreds," other battles usually
reported to have resulted in the death of no more than one or two dozen, and sometimes

less.99 The BaSotho and AmaNgwane witnessed the AmaZulu warriors driving off the cattle
by the thousands, and although one AmaZulu source maintained that all of the cattle died
of disease, Isaacs witnessed the return of the troops with cattle as booty from the impi.00
Upon the death of his mother Nandi in 1827, Shaka moved his capital to Dukuza
south of the Thukela River, closer to the European traders at Port Natal and nearer to the
territory even further southeast about which he harbored expansionist ambitions.101 Nandi's
protective Iziyendane (AmaHlubi) regiments took her death as a threat to themselves and
scattered out of Shaka's control. In 1828 Shaka sent an embassy of several important men
with their wives via boat to Port Elizabeth, but they were prevented from going on to
Cape Town, or to England, their intended destination. While this mission was away Shaka
launched his second major military campaign against the AmaMpondo, scheduled to mark
the anniversary of Nandi's death the year before.'02 Shaka accompanied his troops but biv-
ouacked at Fynn's trading post, marking Fynn to his AmaMpondo trading partners as an
enemy even though Shaka had commandeered Fynn's settlement by compulsion.03
Shaka's army, in two divisions, each subdivided under several commanders, was or-
dered to go beyond the AmaMpondo to Hintsa's territory across the Umtata River, but to
go no further, nor to attack any Europeans they might encounter.04 They destroyed food
crops and took captive AmaMpondo women who were sent back to Shaka, but Shaka (on
Fynn's advice) decided to release these and he accepted the submission of several of Faku's
subordinate chiefs who thereby became tributary to Shaka.'0 Faku sent messages of thanks
and gifts of cattle after the women were returned, but not a formal submission, leaving Shaka
still angry with him.
The sources all agree that Shaka accompanied and commanded this major campaign in
person, but there was no fighting because Faku put up no resistance;
In the Hlambo campaign, Tshaka commanded in person. He crossed the Mzimkulu
and took up a position there whilst the impi went on ahead under the command of
Mdhlaka. Faku directed his men not to attack but to allow the Zulus to seize cattle.
The force accordingly proceeded far away south as far as Esikaleni se Nyoka in the
country of the Bomvana people. On their way thither the Pondos made no attack
at all on them; they did not molest in any way. Tshaka himself stayed in Mbulazi's
[Mbuyazi, i.e. Fynn] kraal a short distance across the Mzimkulu. The impi seized
cattle and returned with them. The Pondos kept out of sight. Faku went off to
the Drakensberg. His own cattle were not seized. He took off [withdrew with]
his father Ngqungqushe's cattle too. The cattle taken were those of his people,
light-brown ones (ezimdubu). Tshaka remained with the Nobamba regiment at the
Mzimkulu.'°6
It appears that although he had rescued his royal herds from Shaka's raiding war-
riors, Faku may have been ready to khonza Shaka and become a tributary subordinate chief.
Several oral traditions relate that it was Faku's representatives who had come with gifts to
Shaka at the moment of Shaka's assassination not long after:

SHAKA'S MILITARY EXPEDITIONS: SURVIVAL AND MORTALITY FROM SHAKA'S IMPIS
The Pondos were defeated and their cattle seized. On the way back Tshaka directed
his forces to go off to Balule. Faku followed him up to pay tribute to him, and was
in the act of doing so when he [Tshaka] was assassinated.107
By the time of this second military campaign against the AmaMpondo, called the uHlam-
bo campaign, Shaka's brothers had begun devising an assassination plot against him, and
Shaka appears to have become aware of it as he was returning home with his troops.108
Before reaching Dukuza Shaka therefore ordered the entire army to proceed without rest-
ing on a military campaign north against Chief Soshoangane's AmaNdwandwe at the Balule
(Olifant's) River northwest of Maputo (Delagoa) Bay.'09 This military campaign against
Soshangane at the Balule River was called the Kukulela ngoqoimpi."0
On their return [from the AmaMpondo campaign] the kukulele ngokoimpi went
forth to the north, Tshaka returning home with the cattle seized. The forces were
not allowed to go home."'
Shaka was said to be crazy to send off his forces without rest, but one informant
explained that "Tshaka sent forth this impi to the north because there had been no actual
fighting with the Pondos, only a seizure of their cattle.""2 Shaka's half-brothers accompa-
nied his military commanders with these troops while Shaka remained behind at the capital
Dukuza, where he suddenly realized he had been left personally undefended.13 Shaka im-
mediately called back the young baggage carriers from the campaign and enrolled them
into a new regiment, the iziNyosi or "Bees," to provide for his own defense."4 Both Fynn's
account and oral traditions relate that Shaka had some of the warriors' wives killed, perhaps
(though this seems unlikely) several hundred, while their husbands were away, on the pretext
that the women had engaged in witchcraft; some traditions relate that this act precipitated
his assassination."' Shaka's half-brothers Mpande and Nzibe remained with the regiments
throughout the campaign, but his half-brothers Dingane and Mhlangana and several other
relatives returned before the impi had even passed through AmaSwazi territory on its way
north, in order to carry out their assassination plot against Shaka."6
One of Stuart's informants, whose father had been in the AmaMpondo campaign and
then "died in the Balule campaign," explained that unbeknownst to Shaka, "Hlangabeza
ka Mabedhla of the amaNtshali tribe had deserted and gone northward after Sotshangana,
with people and cattle" so that "[t]he object [for the AmaZulu impi] was to 'bring back'
Sotshangana, though the more immediate object was to overtake Hlangabeza.""17 With
details that can only have come from participants, he continued,
The Zulus accordingly pursued Hlangabeza, and eventually found out where he
had temporarily erected his kraals. He built alongside a forest. Mdhlaka's impi di-
vided into two after being prepared for action at night-time. One division advanced
on the far side of the forest, whilst the main body came on before daybreak to
make a frontal attack. The forces closed in simultaneously, followed by their mat-
bearers. Every member of the amaNtshali tribe was put to death, and cattle seized.
Hlangabeza himself escaped and got to a pond where he tried to conceal himself

by getting into the water up to his neck. He was, however, observed by the mat-
bearers, who thereupon attacked and put him to death. Prior to this attack, the
princes had returned to Tshaka at Stanger, their object being to kill him."1
Portuguese sources confirm that the AmaZulu forces also engaged in battle with
Soshangane's regiments, as originally planned, and another of Stuart's informants related
that after an indecisive battle with Soshangane's forces who, forewarned, mounted a pre-
emptive night attack, Shaka's regiments headed home. Many of the AmaZulu soldiers sick-
ened and died of malaria on the return route, and of those who recovered it took two to
three months for the sickest to return home.119
From the combined mortality caused by war and disease, thousands of warriors were
thought to have never returned from the Balule campaign. Fearing the loyalty of the return-
ing troops and their commanders to Shaka, who had indeed been assassinated while they
were away, Dingane enrolled a new regiment of the younger men and older men, named
the uHlomendhlini, before the regiments that had gone on the Balule campaign returned.
Shaka's decision to send an impi against Soshangane proved fateful:
An impi was sent to Balule, to Sotshangana. Tshaka's order was that every soul
should go- 'kukulela ngoqo', i.e. take every one, even ungoqo, a man who never
konzas or attends hunting parties or assists in building king's kraals etc., one who is
never seen at the king's kraal. It was in this expedition that Maruyi's father Sonyanga
was killed. Tshaka was at Dukuza when this impi went, and it was during its absence
that Tshaka was assassinated by Mbopa, acting in concert with Mhlangana, Tshaka's
brother, who really instigated the murder. It seems Tshaka went into the cattle kraal
to see his cattle. Whilst there, Mbopa began driving about and beating the cattle.
Tshaka said, 'Why are you beating the cattle?' and as he turned his back to Mbopa,
Mbopa threw an assegai [spear] at him which struck him. He pulled the assegai out
as he ran out of the kraal, but at the gate of the kraal another man lay in wait. This
man snatched the assegai Tshaka carried and stabbed him dead on the spot. The
impi from Balule returned to find him dead.'21
In addition to Shaka's impis, considerable population dislocations were caused by
chiefs and chiefdoms hailing from the KwaZulu region who were subsequently perceived
by others as AmaZulu when they passed through or entered Natal and the Transkei, or
crossed the Drakensberg into the Caledon River valley and TransOrangia region. The flight
southwards from the area of the Thukela and Umzinyati (Buffalo) rivers of the AmaCunu,
AbaTembu and AmaNgwane chiefdoms after Shaka's installation as AmaZulu chief caused
three periods of population disruptions and associated violence in the region of modern
Natal.'2' The status of the Embo chief Zihlandlo and his brother Sambela as tributary and
putatively subordinate chiefs to Shaka lends ambiguity to their perceived identity in the
1820s when, although sending tribute regularly to Shaka, they persisted in carrying out raid-
ing and the killing of other chiefs with relative independence and impunity under Shaka's
rule, but not at Shaka's command.22 The Embo remained powerful and relatively inde-
pendent, in spite of their proffers of allegiance to Shaka, as long as they retalned their own

regiments and herds of raided cattle. The reports about the attacks made by Embo troops
under Zihlandlo and his brother Sambela reflect an endemic level of insecurity and disorder.
Zihlandlo attacked at least seventeen smaller chiefs, killed eleven of them, and confiscated
their cattle.123 Zihlandlo's brother Sambela became a famous fighter as a subordinate chief
to Zihlandlo and made at least fourteen attacks against neighboring chiefs, killing at least
twelve chiefs and capturing their cattle, before Shaka finally attacked and defeated them and
drove Zihlandlo into flight to the south.124
The Wages of War: Mortality and the "Death of Nations"
The use of terms like the "death of nations" reflected the seriousness of the political recon-
figuration resulting from the expansion of AmaZulu authority over regional chiefdoms, and
came to be confused with a presumption regarding the death of people and high mortality
from battles. Warfare was more brutal, and demographic disruptions caused widespread
misery and civilian mortality from famine and disease, but the numbers of warriors killed in
battles and the numbers of civilians killed in military campaigns during the era of Shaka's
rule has been grossly exaggerated in the historiography. The eyewitness testimony and sec-
ondhand oral traditions told to James Stuart came from men, and a few women, whose
social and political networks had been incorporated into the AmaZulu kingdom during
the course of the nineteenth century, but many were descendants of people who had been
victimized by AmaZulu troops in the process of incorporation. As a result there is consider-
able variation as well as independent confirmation with regard to testimony about violence
and atrocities that accompanied warfare, or occurred as random, terrorizing acts initiated by
Shaka or other chiefs. The stories of deaths of civilians as "collateral" victims during military
campaigns, and of both warriors and civilians as the result of ordered executions, as corrobo-
rated by independent European and African sources, are credible as general reports if not
always in their details.125 The sources agree that warfare had become more violent, and when
formal battles were fought hundreds rather than, as previously, only a handful of warriors
might be killed in the fighting before it ended with surrender or a rout. However, levels of
mortality tended to be exaggerated. Some famous campaigns did not result in major battles,
involving opposing regiments of warriors on the battlefield, such as the second AmaMpondo
campaign, because invading AmaZulu forces did not meet with significant resistance and
raided cattle rather than engaging in formal battles. Some military campaigns resulted in
negligible levels of casualties on both sides.
Understanding the processes involved in sociopolitical consolidation and levels of
mortality associated with Shaka's impis is critical for determining population numbers and
the demographic distribution of chiefdoms across the region as European settlement was
expanding in the 1820s and after. The failure to recognize the survival and dispersal and,
sometimes, reconstitution of chiefdoms and their populations following a rout or pre-

ELIZABETH A. ELDREDGE

emptive migration of entire villages led to gross distortions in the historiography regarding
depopulation. Thus as Saunders points out, a statement attributed to a missionary "that
'twenty-eight distinct tribes' had disappeared in this time of upheaval, 'leaving not so much
as a trace of their former existence'," was published in 1843 and again in 1894 although it
was demonstrably false since "the list of these twenty-eight 'tribes' in Chase's 1843 book in-
cluded the names of many Tswana chiefdoms which continued to exist after the Mfecane."26
Wright has made the same case that in spite of the reconfiguration of chiefdoms in the
region of Natal, most people were absorbed into new polities when their own chiefdoms
were dispersed or incorporated wholesale, and of those who emigrated, many returned.127
Among other inflated claims unsupported by any other evidence, Fynn wrote that Matiwane
"destroyed 65 tribes of considerable magnitude, besides numerous small ones, whose names
were not generally known." Fynn conceded, however, that Matiwane "spared none but
those who were willing to join him and by his liberal and fatherly conduct had increased his
people to a considerable number."28
Much of the hyperbolic and unsubstantiated allegations that have persisted suggest-
ing high levels of brutality and mortality in battles originated in Fynn's "Diary," published
in 1950, that has remained one of the most widely available accounts of the period. For
example Fynn wrote that after Shaka had succeeded in building the strength of his military
in terms of numbers of troops, "[h]e now started a desolating and destructive war on all
around, and directed that no quarter was to be given. He ravaged and depopulated the
country to a distance of 300 miles to the westward, 200 miles to the northward and 500
miles to the southward. In this vast area only two tribes, the Ngwane under Matiwane, and
the Nhlungwini under Madikane escaped his destructive powers, and that only by their
becoming roving marauders."129 Fynn wrote that in order to travel quickly some people
were "induced" to "destroy their children when born," but this is not corroborated by any
other sources. He moreover conceded that the mortality resulting from the demographic
locations caused by migrant chiefdoms in Natal and into the Transkei region was minimal.
Rather, "these chiefs who attacked several of the large tribes west of the Umzimkhulu, be-
ing more desirous for cattle than for the destruction of people, [therefore] that so many of
those tribes escaped who passed forward to the frontiers and now form the principal part of
those tribes by whom they are held in much subjection and are termed 'Fingoes,' a name of
degradation."'"30
Similarly Shepstone acknowledged that of the people living in the Thukela River val-
ley, "several of them were allowed by Chaka to occupy their lands as tributaries, on their
promptly tendering their submission to him; others were attacked and driven further South."
However, "one the Amakabela, although repeatedly attacked, and reduced to live upon
roots and wild animals, perseveringly clung to the ancient homes," so that some survived
there to the time of his writing in l864.'T' When Shepstone listed what he referred to as
ninety-four "tribes" that had occupied the region "now called Natal," he included many

small chiefdoms that would have amounted to no more than a dozen families living in three
or four related homesteads; there were only a handful of chiefdoms that had managed to
accumulate adherents that could be counted in the hundreds or thousands of people.132
At the time he was writing in 1864, he could identify the descendants of forty-three of
these "tribes" still living in Natal, but he was also able to locate many of these small chief-
doms who were still identifiable living where they had relocated in the region of Transkei.33
Shepstone also noted that the disappearance of identifiable sociopolitical units could be ex-
plained by the dispersal of these communities, rather than their complete destruction, only
the chiefs' families having been killed.34 According to one African source, when Shaka first
went to the region of Natal himself""he found that the whole of Natal had been denuded of
its former population."13 Shaka was told by the AmaCele chief that his regiments had been
responsible for raids and their destructive effects in the area, but nevertheless the subjects of
the AmaCele and AmaThuli were still there, as were regiments that had been stationed there
by Shaka.
The histories of the migrant chiefdoms of the AmaNdebele (AmaKhumalo) and the
AmaNgwane also demonstrate the survival of people on a large scale even after demograph-
ic displacement. The extent to which the dislocation of a chiefdom from one location to
another resulted in raids, battles, and the deaths of warriors or civilians must be consid-
ered individually with regard to each instance of conflict, and depopulation cannot be as-
sumed. There were other significant factors affecting mortality levels among the popula-
tion of KwaZulu-Natal and the wider region of southeastern Africa, including the Transkei,
Caledon River valley and Lesotho, Orange Free State, and Transvaal areas, in the 1820s and
1830s. There were widespread reports of famine, and these were related to droughts affect-
ing the entire area in the early 1820s, as well as the destruction of standing crops by military
regiments moving en masse to capture cattle and, where necessary, suppress resistance from
the victims of their raids. Many soldiers who went into the malaria-ridden region of southern
Mozambique succumbed to that disease and did not return home from battle. Shaka carried
out executions and even massacres of villagers who were his own subjects as individual and
collective punishments, behavior so repugnant even to the people closest to him that his
mother is said to have reprimanded him for killing his own people. The numbers of people
under Shaka's rule who were killed by his order in executions and massacres appear to have
amounted to as many or more as the deaths inflicted and incurred in military expeditions
and battles, and the decision of his half-brothers to assassinate Shaka was attributed in oral
sources to his atrocities against his own subjects.
Trying to estimate the numbers of dead in baffles fought by Shaka's impis seems cal-
lous and inevitably underestimates the human toll as families lost loved ones, and the lost so-
cial and economic contributions of each individual who died senselessly can never be known.
The numbers of people killed in Shaka's military expeditions may also have been exceeded

and the loss of cattle. But many military campaigns sent to enforce the submission of smaller
chiefs as tributaries to Shaka's rule did not result in any fighting at all when allegiance was
promptly forthcoming. Even when these early battles were fought, most resulted in dozens
rather than hundreds or thousands killed, and even some major campaigns such as the sec-
ond campaign against the AmaMpondo did not result in any fighting. From the evidence
there appear to have been only a handful of battles in which hundreds of warriors died,
and mortality figures in the range of several thousand killed in battles fought by AmaZulu
troops during Shaka's reign are only reported for two battles, the first (amabece) campaign
against the AmaMpondo in 1824 in which the majority of casualties appear to have been
AmaZulu warriors, and the 1826 battle in which the AmaNdwandwe then under Zwide's
son Sikhunyana were finally defeated north of the Phongolo River. About eight thousand
warriors, mostly AmaZulu, were also said to have died in the Balule campaign, although it is
impossible to distinguish therein between losses in battle and losses from disease. Mortality
counted in the hundreds in a single battle were still considered staggering, as occurred in
three battles fought by the AmaNgwane west of the Drakensberg against the AmaHlubi, the
AmaZulu, and the BaSotho; losses counted in the thousands in a single battle were unex-
pected and unacceptable even during Shaka's rule. The violence inflicted by Shaka's warriors
and by other predatory chiefs, including Makedama, Zihlandlo, and Sambela were targeted
towards chiefs and sometimes their immediate families, rather than entire populations.
In sum the number of people including Shaka's warriors who were killed in battles in-
volving impis sent by Shaka, or commanded by these subordinate chiefs, certainly amounted
to ten thousand dead, and the true figure was probably twice that number. These figures do
not take into account mortality arising from other battles and fights across the wider region
involving other chiefs and chiefdoms, nor the associated death from famines known to have
occurred west of the Drakensberg during the droughts of the 1820s.'36 As terrible and dra-
matic as these figures are, they are far lower than the one to two million deaths attributed to
Shaka's rule that were estimated in the early historiography.
The widespread use of force and the threat of force to reconfigure the political and
social organization of southern Africa in the era of Shaka's reign underscores the false and
artificial presumptions of modern claims of "ethnicity" associated with supposed "primor-
dial" cultural identities. This history decisively undermines the legitimacy of any contem-
porary political, social, or economic claims on the basis of putative but false "primordial"
socio-cultural origins. Processes of cultural assimilation followed upon the turmoil and
sociopolitical reconfiguration of the 1820s and 1830s, disguising the cultural, political, and
social (and biological) heterogeneity of modern political identities that only emerged later
in the nineteenth century. Cultural "identities" or modern "ethnicities" currently masquer-
ade, in the words of the Comaroffs, as "the manifest product of biology, genetics, human
essence," with damaging political and economic consequences. Hence the historical decon-

struction of the processes of sociopolitical incorporation and amalgamation are more salient
than ever to modern politics and economic dispensations.137
The supposed "primordial" origins of modern ethnic identities such as the modern
Zulu "identity" are contrived from false claims that threaten renewed conflicts. Associated
economic and financial claims to benefits are based on a false representation of past political
and cultural history. The wages of war in battle and beyond as experienced by the people of
southern Africa in the 1820s and 1830s were high, and by the time Protestant missionaries
became active in the region in the 1820s and 1830s, populations across the region knew
they were recovering from a long period of chronic violence that had sometimes uprooted
entire chiefdoms and brought death from violence and famine. Wherever they found them-
selves settled, communities regrouped and replanted and rebuilt, and through their oral
traditions they remembered their relatives and their ancestors who had not lived to see the
reconfigured chiefdoms and kingdoms of the 1820s and 1830s that created a new legacy for
subsequent generations.
Notes
1.  This article is part of a larger project on the pre-colonial history of southeastern Africa encompassing
modern KwaZulu-Natal, Lesotho, Swaziland, and southern Mozambique with reference to adjacent
areas and developments from 1400 to 1830. Research for this project was supported by grants from
a Senior Scholar Fulbright Research Fellowship and the Social Science Research Council, and a
Michigan State University All-University Research Grant. I am grateful for the (non-financial)
support and encouragement I received for this work from the Departments of History at the
University of Durban-Westville, the National University of Lesotho, the University of Swaziland,
and the Universidade Eduardo Mondlane during the tenure of my research grants, December
1993-November 1994. I am especially grateful to the staff at the Killie Campbell Library where
most of the research for this article was conducted.
2.  In English historical renditions, the term impi has been used to refer to regiments, units, or to the
military campaigns on which they were sent.

8.  For example, the AmaNgwane chiefdom under Matiwane was displaced several times, from northern
KwaZulu to the Caledon River valley, and again to the Transkei, each time re-establishing itself
and exerting dominance over neighboring displaced peoples who were raided, incorporated, or,
as in the case of the new BaSotho kingdom under Moshoeshoe, paid tribute. However there were
significantly lower levels of mortality in battles than have been commonly assumed, and the total
numbers of persons killed in battles in which the AmaNgwane ever engaged were counted in the
hundreds rather than the thousands. Elizabeth A. Eldredge, "Migration, Conflict, and Leadership

referred not to the literal death of people but to the end of the existence of the sociopolitical units
in which they lived.

Caledon River region is summarized below. The arrival of the AmaHlubi and AmaNgwane in the
Caledon River valley in 1821, as remembered by the people they disrupted and then told to French
missionaries upon their arrival in Lesotho in 1833, dates the dispersal of the AmaHlubi chiefdom

enrolled in the iziNyosi regiment enrolled during the Balule campaign, and later fight honorably
in AmaZulu campaigns under Dingane and Mpande. This decisive battle in which the AmaZulu
defeated the AmaNdwandwe can be dated with some precision because just as they were returning
from this battle against Sikhunyana "a vessel that had arrived on 6th October, 1826, from Algoa
Bay, proved to be the schooner Anne, with Mr. King and Mrs. Farewell on board." Fynn, Diary,

the fighting going on. Matiwane was then chased by the Zulus via Basutoland; he was caused to

We can assume the final battle and defeat of the AmaHlubi was in late 1824 or early 1825 because it
was said to have occurred at the same time that Moshoeshoe migrated with his people from Butha-
Buthe to Thaba Bosiu known to have occurred then. Ellenberger's work reflects a meticulous record

defensive of both the Cape Colonists and those Africans with whom he lived and worked, many of
whom were his own direct family members through marriage. Fynn, Diary, 143.

110. Mkehlengana, 217. He said that his famous father, Zulu, "also started forth on the Kukulela ngoqo
impi to the uBalule but was injured unexpectedly in the foot (right foot). This was reported to
Tshaka, so he told him to come back, which he did," Makewu, 163. Because on this occasion the
mobilization of all invalids and indigent men (e.g., even the unqoqo - see third following quote in
main text) was deemed an extraordinary act of total mobilization, the term "khukhulelangoqo" later
came to refer to wholesale mobilization, and by extension implied total destruction and devastation.
111. Mcotoyi, 55.
112. Mkehlengana, 217; he named the izinduna in charge of both AmaZulu impisto the south, referring
to the first as against the abeNguni and the second against the AmaMpondo. Melapi said,"Tshaka
gave orders to the Pondo impi south of the Mzimkulu and directed it to go to the north when he
was there [with the impi in the south]. When he was assassinated he was said to have bunguleka'd,
i.e., gone mad by giving such an order." Melapi, 83.
113. Maziyana, 297, named all of the AmaZulu military commanders who went on "this campaign to
Balule." Madikane ka Mlomowetole (1903, 1905) in JSA v.2, 61, provided details of the routes

128. Fynn, Diary, 318. Although the designation of a chiefdom as "of considerable magnitude" is
ambiguous, it is self-evident that there were not "65 tribes of considerable magnitude" in the
southeastern Africa in the early nineteenth century, much less in the more limited regions traversed
by Matiwane's AmaNgwane.

133. Shepstone wrote, "That several of those aboriginal Tribes who migrated to the South, such as the
very considerable ones of the Amabele, the Amazizi and others, are at present among the people
called Fingoes, in the Frontier Districts of the Cape Colony; and that three, the Amavundhle, the
Abashwau and the Amabaca, occupy the territory called 'No Man's Land,' to the south of Natal,
while a section of the Amabaca are in Natal; a fourth, the Amaxesibe, now live on the border of 'No
Man's Land."' Shepstone, par. 49.
134. He wrote "[t]hat thirty nine of the aboriginal Tribes were so completely dispersed and their reigning
families annihilated, that they no longer exist as separate Tribes, but some of the individuals
belonging to them congregated and formed others [other 'Tribes'],-not under hereditary
Chiefs,-such as the Amaduma, and those enumerated under Table II Class No.2 [in his lists]; and
that others have become incorporated with these aboriginal communities." Shepstone, par.50.

created by Mzilikazi's AmaNdebele on the western highveld, see Margaret Kinsman, "'Hungry
Wolves: The Impact of Violence on Rolong Life, 1823-1836," in Hamilton, ed., 363-93.
137. John L. and Jean Comaroff, Ethnicity, Inc. (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2009),
1, demonstrates the modern metamorphosis of putative ethnic claims into claims of cultural
ownership and consequent preemptory commercial claims in contemporary South Africa, with
haunting and disturbing echoes of apartheid-era claims to resources based on supposed primordial
and therefore uncontestable (although false) cultural or biological birthrights.

This Festschrift captures the intellectual spirit at the heart of David
Henige's scholarship over the past four decades: a rigorous examination
of evidence (oral and written) and the development of a "good practice"
[in engaging] the critical processes by which we know what we know,
or conclude that we cannot really know... The essays in The Power of
Doubt-on European accounts of indigenous warfare in late nineteenth-
century East Africa, European explorers and their Luso-African guides,
oral traditions juxtaposed with written accounts of Kongo's history,
and paradigmatic shifts when indigenous anthropologists conduct field-
work in Mali [inter alia]-reflect the expanse of Henige's scholarly
engagements, which also transcended Africa. Prefaced by Paul Landau's
thoughtful introduction and commentary on Henige's philosophy of
knowledge, the essays underscore Henige's abiding commitment to
evidence over theory, his comfort with the messiness of the past, and his
unswerving espousal of the historian's mandate.
