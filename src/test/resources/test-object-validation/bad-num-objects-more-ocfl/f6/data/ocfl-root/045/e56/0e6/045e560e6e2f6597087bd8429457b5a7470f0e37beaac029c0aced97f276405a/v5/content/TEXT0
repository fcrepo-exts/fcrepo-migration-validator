73. Mgidhlana, 107.
74. Mbovu ka Mtshumayeli in JSA v.3, 43.
75. Maziyana, 272. Shaka's attention to the southwest is also said to have been aroused by a provocative
message sent to him by Chief Nguboyencuga of the AbaTembu claiming he had superior forces,
before then fleeing further west into the domains of the AmaXhosa chiefdoms on the eastern Cape
Colony frontier.
76. Nduna, 4; Lugubu, 282, 287; Makewu, 163; Mkehlengana, 217; Maziyana, 272-73; Mcotoyi ka
Mnini in JSA v.3, 55; Mbovu, 43; Fynn, Diary, 62. It was evidently these returning regiments,
estimated at 20,000 men or more, who were encountered and observed by Fynn on 11 March
1824, a day after his trading party first landed at Port Natal (Durban) to open up a trade in ivory.
77. Mkehlengana, 217.
78. Mcotoyi ka Mnini in JSA v. 3, 66. He provided this information elsewhere in his interview, when
he named Shaka's commanders on this expedition; 55.
79. Maziyana, 272-73. He also named the military commanders on this campaign.

Caffres, edited by Stephen Gray (Durban: Killie Campbell Africana Library and Pietermaritzburg:

fighting, however.

87. Maclean (John Ross), 67-69, citing the contemporaneous eyewitness reports of his European
associates to him.
88. Ndukwana in interview of Jantshi, 186. Ndukwana said Zwide's sons Somapunga, Nqabeni,
Mlomo, and others returned to give their allegiance to Shaka, and that Nqabeni and Mlomo were
enrolled in the iziNyosi regiment enrolled during the Balule campaign, and later fight honorably
in AmaZulu campaigns under Dingane and Mpande. This decisive battle in which the AmaZulu
defeated the AmaNdwandwe can be dated with some precision because just as they were returning
from this battle against Sikhunyana "a vessel that had arrived on 6th October, 1826, from Algoa
Bay, proved to be the schooner Anne, with Mr. King and Mrs. Farewell on board." Fynn, Diary,
129.
89. Fynn, Diary, 127-30, and Nathaniel Isaacs, cited by Stuart and Malcolm, ibid.
90. The trader Nathaniel Isaacs was among the injured. The European and African sources are in
agreement with regard to this account and that there were few deaths. Nathaniel Isaacs, Travels and
Adventures in Eastern Africa, edited with footnotes and a biographical sketch by Louis Herman
(Cape Town: Van Riebeeck Society, 1936), v.1, 163, 170-71; Baleni ka Silwana, 18; Mkehlengana
ka Zulu, 215; Ndukwana, 289, 17.
91. Mbokodo, 12.
92. Mabonsa, 14; Ngidi, 54. After the AmaNgwane defeat of the AmaHlubi west of the Drakensberg
in 1824/5, "Matiwane was presently attacked by the Zulus, just as if they had come to interfere in
the fighting going on. Matiwane was then chased by the Zulus via Basutoland; he was caused to
cross the Jsangqu [Orange River], but the Zulus did not cross." Mbokodo, 17. Also Fynn, Diary,
318.
93. D.F.Ellenberger, History of the Basuto Ancient and Modern (London: Caxton Pub., 1912), 154-55.
We can assume the final battle and defeat of the AmaHlubi was in late 1824 or early 1825 because it
was said to have occurred at the same time that Moshoeshoe migrated with his people from Butha-
Buthe to Thaba Bosiu known to have occurred then. Ellenberger's work reflects a meticulous record
