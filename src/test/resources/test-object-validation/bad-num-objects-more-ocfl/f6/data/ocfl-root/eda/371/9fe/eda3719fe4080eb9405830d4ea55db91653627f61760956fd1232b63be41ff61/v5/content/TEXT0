Although the story was about the Rengen people's ancient conflict with the Kadokini
people over the sharing of food, the story also referred to the young man's inhospitable
treatment of Lomoye the day before. By narrating the story of Kadokini, Lokodoi was draw-
ing the audience's attention to the moral responsibility of sharing food and resources in
social interactions. Although Lomoye was in the audience and could have admitted the
pain of being rejected and humiliated, he ignored the apparent message of the story which
conveyed how he must have felt after that mistreatment and rejection. At the end of his
performance, Lokodoi stated, "the refusal of food is the ultimate rejection." With his story
Lokodoi powerfully illustrated the implication of rejection through the formulaic medium
of the historical tradition. The ancient memory images of the Kadokini people's experience
carried a discourse and experience which Lomoye lived through in the present; concurrently,
Lomoye's experience provided the social context for the performance of the historical tradi-
tion. In everyday experience, people react differently to the refusal and rejection of food, wa-
ter, pasture and other scarce resources in Najie, but Lokodoi's performance of the historical
tradition mirrored the ancestral complex of denial described and detailed in the story. The
performance had the impact it had because audience members shared certain experience and
knowledge of his chosen images. Common experience provided the communion between
the performer and the audience and they both came to terms with the reality of living in an
environment where resources are scarce and survival depends on sharing; this is perhaps why
the plots of Jie historical traditions are usually set in the long dry seasons, when the society
experiences political and environmental crises.
The story of Kodokini is not the only explanatory story that refers to ancestral in-
cidents. Certain versions of the stories of Lodiny and Orwakol, Nayeche and Ngolengiro
preserve these explanatory themes for human relations, embodying the troubling memories
which force the Jie people to redefine their social relations in contemporary contexts.
A similar historical tradition was invoked by Rianaro one evening in 1996. It was
prompted by the actions of a man whom I shall call Lowotomoe-the owner of a famed,
powerful bull also named Lowotomoe. The story transpired in the kraal in Koteen
where both Lowotomoe's and Rianaro's cattle grazed. Rianaro, who apparently wanted
Lowotomoe's famous bull to mount his cows, made several attempts to convince him but
Lowotomoe persistently rejected the request. Rianaro and other people in the kraal consid-
ered Lowotomoe's refusal to be parsimonious, shameful, and unfriendly. Finally, one eve-
ning Rianaro confronted Lowotomoe for his unfriendly gesture and decided to discuss this
matter with his friends and close kin in his etem in the kraal. He sent a message to people in
the villages asking several of his kin to join him in the kraal. Lodoch and I joined the group
and went to Koteen to participate in the discussion.
On that moonlit night, several men sat on the course of the dry riverbed around the
campfire and talked and talked.33 The discussion that night focused on the discourse of
friendship and sharing, as they made references to various heroic leaders of the historical
